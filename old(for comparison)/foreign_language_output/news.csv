675,"As pet insurance booms in Korea, so does fraud","A dog is being carried by a veterinarian at an animal clinic in Dongjak District, southern Seoul, on Aug, 5, 2024. [YONHAP] Until recently, a middle-aged Korean man who owns four dogs made more than 120 visits to a veterinary clinic over the past 27 months. Using pet insurance, he claimed 58 million won (approximately $42,000) to cover their supposed treatment and surgery costs. But an investigation by his insurance company later revealed that the pet owner had colluded with his son, head of the veterinary clinic he frequented, to falsify the dogs' diagnoses and medical records in order to receive maximum insurance payouts. The scam is one of a growing number of pet insurance frauds, as more people in Korea become pet owners and enroll their animals in insurance plans. Related Article Behind the bug-loving Korean teenager drawing buzz online for his pet hornet training videos Not just a pet project: Dog and cat owners are all in on health supplements The total number of pet insurance subscriptions reached 162,111 as of the end of last year — more than a 20-fold increase since 2018, per the General Insurance Association of Korea and the Korea Insurance Research Institute. Nine local non-life insurance companies, including Samsung Fire & Marine, DB Insurance, KB Insurance and Hyundai Marine & Fire, offer pet insurance covering dogs and cats, typically including their treatment costs, liability for dog bites and funeral expenses. Although the market is expanding, experts say there is insufficient transparency in the system and related laws to minimize fraud. One insurer reported 58 fraud cases in the first half of this year alone — more than six times higher than the same period last year. ""Since all veterinary treatment costs are classified as non-covered [meaning not covered by public insurance], there is a high risk that a loss structure similar to that seen in private health insurance—caused by overtreatment—could emerge,"" said a General Insurance Association spokesperson. “There are many suspicious claims, but they’re hard to detect.” Common pet insurance scams A stray dog is at a veterinary clinic getting treatment [JOONGANG ILBO] So, what does pet insurance fraud look like? A man in his 40s adopted over 30 stray dogs and received a year’s worth of free insurance up to 10 million won, which is offered by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to those who adopt strays. He then asked clinics to mislabel conditions — reporting a covered injury like cruciate ligament rupture instead of a non-covered one like luxating patella — and billed neutering surgeries as more expensive laser treatments. In other cases, owners enrolled a single pet in multiple insurance plans and submitted duplicate claims for the same procedure, listing different family members as the claimant. Some insured only one dog but used the plan to cover treatment for multiple pets of the same breed, bypassing the cost of insuring each animal. Others who owned pets with pre-existing conditions — which are typically not covered by insurance — re-enrolled their animal in insurance plans under a new name and owner, often the policyholder’s spouse, to hide their medical history and make their conditions eligible for insurance. Low pet registration rate hampers oversight A significant issue in pet insurance is the lack of transparency. Only 30 percent of dogs in Korea are officially registered, and cats aren’t required to register at all. Even for registered pets, identification can be challenging. “Pet ID tags can be swapped, and even vets can’t identify animals based solely on nose prints,” a DB Insurance official said. A dog is taking a stroll with its owner in Daejeon, on Feb. 16, 2025 [JOONGANG ILBO] Another issue is the lack of standardized fees and disease codes in veterinary care. Unlike human healthcare, there’s no fixed pricing system, and disease classification isn’t standardized. The Ministry of Agriculture recently introduced 3,511 animal disease categories and 4,930 diagnostic codes — including for initial visits and hospitalizations — but their use remains voluntary, leaving leeway for some clinics to work with pet owners in committing insurance fraud. Also, existing penalties for violating veterinary regulations are low and criminal charges are rare. Push for reform and standardization To address growing concerns, Korea’s financial authorities advised insurers in May to shorten the renewal cycle for pet insurance to one year and increase the policyholder’s share of costs to 30 percent. While some insurers have adopted these changes, they’re cautious about going too far and driving consumers away. “Raising out-of-pocket costs due to fraud could hurt honest pet owners,” an industry source said. “People love their pets, but many don’t realize that misusing insurance this way is a crime.” Experts argue that standardizing fees and improving transparency are crucial for reducing fraud and enabling consumers to better predict costs. “Setting clear, uniform prices and disease classifications will prevent fraud and improve trust in the system,” said Han Jin-hyun, a researcher at the Korea Insurance Research Institute. Kim Kyu-dong, head of a unit at KB Insurance, emphasized the need for collaboration among insurers, government agencies, and the veterinary community. “Insurers can use treatment and claim data by breed and age to design better products, while the government should improve the pet registration system for more accurate identification,"" he said.

[JOONGANG ILBO] President Lee Jae Myung has pledged to promote pet insurance by introducing standardized veterinary fees.

Blue Flag certification is an international eco-label awarded to beaches that are clean and eco-friendly by the non-profit Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), based in Denmark. It evaluates beaches on 137 criteria across water quality, safety, environmental education and facilities. Related Article Sol Beach Namhae brings the best of the region to the best of hospitality Looking for a beach escape? North Korea just opened one. Sinji Myeongsasimni Beach, one of Wando County's representative vacation spots, has earned the Blue Flag certification for eight consecutive years. Among 5,042 beaches worldwide that received the status this year, including five in Korea, Sinji Myeongsasimni Beach was also named in the certification's global “Special Mention Top 10.” The beach opened on Saturday to this summer's vacationers, in tandem with the annual ""Mt.

684,Wife who rammed car after catching husband with another woman gets suspended sentence,"[JOONGANG ILBO] A 49-year-old woman who intentionally rammed her car into another woman’s vehicle after seeing her husband get out of it has been granted leniency by the court, according to the ruling on Saturday. She received a six-month suspended prison sentence at the Chuncheon District Court in Chuncheon-si, Gangwon. Related Article Court lenient on bus driver who killed 2 soldiers on e-scooters Yoon to not appear at insurrection court hearing after being taken into custody, legal team says A suspended sentence is given when a court has found the defendant guilty and decided on a punishment, but delays enforcing the sentence for a set period — typically because the offense was minor and the defendant has shown remorse or has no prior record. If the defendant commits no further crimes during this probationary period, which is usually one to two years in Korea, the sentence is not carried out, and the conviction is effectively dismissed. However, if they reoffend, the original sentence can be enforced along with new penalties. “The sentence was determined by taking into account that the defendant admitted wrongdoing and showed remorse, has no prior convictions, the injuries were relatively minor, a settlement was reached, and there were somewhat understandable circumstances behind the offense,” said the case’s judge, Song Jong-hwan. In April 2024, the defendant spotted her husband getting out of a vehicle being driven by another woman, 48, across from a restaurant in Chuncheon-si. Upon seeing the vehicle depart, she tailed it. The defendant then deliberately struck the front passenger side of the other woman’s car with the front bumper of her own vehicle in an attempt to stop it. As a result of the collision, the other woman sustained injuries requiring two weeks of recovery, and vehicle repair costs amounted to approximately 1.7 million won (around $1,300). The defendant was prosecuted on charges of aggravated property damage and aggravated assault. The defendant has also since filed a civil lawsuit against the other woman, alleging that she had an affair with her husband.

685,"North Korea supplies 40% of Russia's ammunition, Ukrainian intel chief tells Bloomberg","A building in Odesa, Ukraine, is damaged by a Russian drone strike on June 11. [REUTERS/YONHAP] North Korea is supplying as much as 40 percent of Russia's ammunition used in the war in Ukraine, according to a Bloomberg report on Saturday. It cites Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who told the news outlet that  “North Korea has huge stockpiles and production goes on around the clock.” Related Article Trump administration resumes sending some weapons to Ukraine after Pentagon pause Top U.S. military officer calls for trilateral cooperation amid military buildup by North Korea, China He added that North Korea is supplying not only ammunition but also ballistic missiles and artillery systems to Russia, noting, “Those are good weapons.” In the past three months, about 60 percent of the losses suffered by Ukrainian intelligence units were due to artillery fire using North Korean-made weapons, Budanov said. Since signing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty with Russia last year, North Korea has been strengthening its military cooperation with Moscow. Military intelligence authorities in Ukraine and the West believe that North Korea’s arms support is a key factor prolonging Russia’s invasion. Bloomberg noted that it could not independently verify Budanov’s claims. Continuing evidence, however, suggests that North Korean weapons are being actively used on the Ukrainian frontlines. The Ukrainian military on Saturday, for instance, released a video on its Telegram channel showing the destruction caused by the North Korean-made weapons on the front lines. The video showed a North Korean Type 75 multiple rocket launcher that was hidden in the bushes in Kupiansk, eastern Ukraine, being destroyed by a drone strike. The Ukrainian military said the strike was carried out by the First Presidential Burevii Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, claiming, “North Korea couldn’t withstand the reality of the front lines.” Ukraine had also released a video last month showing the destruction of a North Korean-made M1991 multiple rocket launcher supplied to Russia. Security experts believe North Korea is using the war in Ukraine to test the performance of its conventional weapons and to gain real combat experience through proxy deployment. Regarding U.S. President Donald Trump, Budanov told Bloomberg: “His position [on ceasefire] is consistent, one should not judge him by media characteristics,” and added, “As head of a special service, I know more things,” signaling support for Trump. Budanov then went on to emphasize that ceasefire negotiations should be reached within this year, stating, “Is it realistic to do so - yes. Is it difficult - no.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

686,A touching love story with a 'shocking' finale: 'Let Me In' returns to Korea,"Actors for the Korean rendition of play ″Let the Right One In″ rehearse at the National Theater of Korea in central Seoul on July 8. [YONHAP] Eli, a vampire girl, often meets Oskar, the boy next door, in the woods. At first, Eli draws a line, telling Oscar, “I can’t be your friend.” But as they spend more time together, they grow closer, and their feelings for one another deepen. Eli tries to hide her identity from Oskar, but the truth is what it is — she is a being who cannot survive without drinking human blood. The play “Let the Right One In” is based on the 2004 novel of the same title by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist. It is familiar to Korean audiences thanks to the 2008 Swedish film adaptation, better known as “Let Me In” in Korea. The story was first adapted for the stage in 2013 by the National Theatre of Scotland. It premiered in Korea in 2016 and is being revived this year for the first time in nine years. A 2020 performance was scheduled but ultimately canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. At its core, “Let the Right One In” is a story of the fragile love between two wounded souls. Oscar, a lonely boy bullied by classmates who force him to eat dirt and call him names, finds his only friend in Eli. But Eli, who has survived for centuries feeding on human blood in hiding, is just as isolated. They fall in love while sharing each other’s pain — but a romance between an immortal vampire and a mortal boy aging day by day is hardly simple. Onstage, these delicate emotions are conveyed through not only dialogue, but also physical expression. The cast moves with choreographed precision, and their subtle physical gestures often speak louder than words. The original 2016 production left one viewer commenting that it “felt like a dance play” — a sentiment echoed in the current revival. John Tiffany, the play’s original director, said in a recent video interview with Korean media that the characters express their longing for connection through choreography. Oskar, in particular, struggles to articulate his emotions and feels emotionally misunderstood, so dance becomes a key outlet for his inner world. A recurring Morse code exchange between Eli and Oskar serves as a symbolic gesture of their bond. While a love story at heart, “Let the Right One In” also dabbles in horror. True to its vampire theme, blood appears throughout the show, with several chilling and graphic moments. Scenes where crimson blood stains white snow capture the production’s mix of beauty and brutality. Even the production team offers a stark warning. “The final 10 minutes feature a shocking scene unlike anything I’ve ever seen — I couldn’t even blink,” said the Korean associate director. The set is equally striking. With just a jungle gym and a streetlamp as props, the stage is filled with a birch forest that evokes a haunting atmosphere. An Seoung-gyun and Cheon Woo-jin alternate in the role of Oskar while Gwon Seul-ah and Baek Seung-yeon alternate Eli. An reprises his role from the original 2016 production. Gwon had been cast as Eli in the canceled 2020 run, and, after a second audition, finally takes the stage in this year’s revival. “Let the Right One In” runs through Aug. 16 at the Haeoreum Grand Theater at the National Theater of Korea in Jangchung-dong, central Seoul.

687,"Naver focuses on enterprise messaging, AI services to secure growth in Japan after Line ordeal","Kim Yu-won, CEO of Naver Cloud, speaks about the future direction of the company’s business in Japan at a hotel in Osaka on July 9. [NAVER CLOUD] Naver is ramping up its business in Japan with a focus on enterprise messaging and AI-driven services, seeking to secure long-term growth after weathering last year’s turbulence surrounding Line Yahoo. The Line Yahoo ordeal — where the Japanese government pressured Naver to reduce its stake in Line, a messaging app popular in the country — threatened to destabilize Naver’s operations in Japan, but the fallout proved smaller than feared.

What's the deal? Speaking to reporters Wednesday at a hotel in Osaka, Kim Yu-won, CEO of Naver Cloud, laid out the company’s plans for its business-to-business (B2B) projects in Japan. Naver has maintained the top spot in Japan’s paid enterprise messaging market for seven straight years since 2017, according to research firm Fuji Chimera. Now it aims to build on that with two key initiatives: transitioning its Line Works platform into an AI-powered service, and expanding its AI CareCall program — marketed as Clova CareCall in Korea — which helps check on older people living alone. “We’re combining AI with on-the-ground operations in Japan’s slow-to-digitize sectors, fundamentally transforming work in the process. These two services will set a new milestone for Naver’s business in Japan,” Kim said. Related Article Naver won't shed Line Yahoo equity in short term SoftBank, Naver 'recognize the difficulties' of cutting off Line Yahoo Line Yahoo CEO confirms push to reduce Naver's control Naver faced one of its biggest challenges in Japan last year when the Japanese government pushed Line Yahoo to break away technologically from Naver and pressed for Naver to reduce its stake. While the episode rattled nerves, it ultimately didn’t hit as hard as many feared. Naver has kept its stake in Line Yahoo and even took home a hefty dividend of 706.6 billion won ($515 million) last year. Although Line Yahoo is moving ahead with plans to become technologically independent, Naver still expects to earn revenue from technology licensing until the separation fully takes shape. “We think the concerns tied to Line are now resolved,” Kim said. “But from here on out, we’ll run our Japan businesses clearly separate from Line.” An older resident living alone in Izumo, a city in Shimane Prefecture, Japan, uses Naver Cloud's AI CareCall service. The firm launched a pilot project for the AI service with the city. [NAVER CLOUD] Finding success in Japan Naver Cloud made an early bet on Japan’s workplace culture a decade ago, recognizing how deeply Japanese employees separate personal and professional spheres. It launched Line Works as a dedicated business messenger, targeting mobile and field operations that global giants like Google and Microsoft largely overlooked. The strategy paid off. As of January, Line Works served 590,000 corporate clients and had 5.8 million users. Shimaoka Takeshi, head of Line Works Corporation, said, “We added features tailored to workers in the field, like mobile-based attendance and inventory tracking, so even employees with low digital literacy could use the service without special training. That proved hugely effective.” Looking ahead, Naver Cloud plans to embed more AI into Line Works. The platform will soon feature an “AI Agent,” which analyzes chats, emails, and calendars to automatically handle repetitive tasks, such as daily reports. The company also plans to roll out its AI CareCall program nationwide in Japan. The service utilizes AI to monitor older residents and identify any unusual signs. About 140 local governments in Korea are already using it, which Kim said proves its reliability. In Japan, Naver recently completed a successful pilot in Izumo, a city in Shimane Prefecture known for its aging population. Naver Cloud executive Kim Dong-hoe explained the local need: “A manager in Izumo might oversee nearly 70 seniors, meaning they only call once or twice a month and can’t hire more staff. Our AI CareCall checks around 40 detailed health and lifestyle items each time, then generates a report. That’s why it’s gotten such a strong response there.” Kim Yu-won, CEO of Naver Cloud, shares the firm's business plans in Japan at a hotel in Osaka on July 9. [YONHAP] Japan’s outsized role for Naver Japan is more than just another overseas market for Naver. It’s where founder and chair Lee Hae-jin personally championed Line into the ranks of Japan’s national messaging apps. Last year, Naver’s revenue from Japan reached 899.3 billion won, accounting for 59 percent of its 1.53 trillion won global revenue. Naver had initially hoped to scale up its Japanese business by partnering more closely with SoftBank, which runs Yahoo Japan. But after the Line Yahoo crisis, it now faces the task of building out stand-alone models. “Solving each country’s social issues through technology is what we mean by sovereign AI,” Kim Yu-won said. “Based on what we’ve achieved in Japan, we’ll expand to other countries facing similar challenges.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

689,Why are university graduation albums fading away?,"Pukyong National University students take a group photo that will be used in the university graduation album, on June 3, 2020. [SONG BONG-GEUN] With August just around the corner and many university students set to graduate, soon-to-be graduates have a lot of boxes to check off. From taking graduation album photos, completing a thesis or graduation exam and attending the graduation ceremony to finally receiving the university diploma, the list goes on and on. However, taking photos for the university graduation album may soon disappear from the list. Related Article Korean universities host graduation ceremonies — in pictures Ewha Womans University to hold spring graduation ceremony, international student youngest Ph.D. graduate KAIST graduation ceremony to feature international student as speaker for first time ever Universities traditionally make graduation albums that feature individual portraits of the graduating class in their graduation gowns and caps, with students signing up to be part of the album and taking photos throughout the year. Albums are usually distributed once a year during the February graduation ceremony, featuring graduates of the two previous semesters. Those set to graduate in August take photos with a studio that partners with the university around May and June, with February graduates taking photos around September and October the previous year. Helping graduates cherish their memories, the graduation albums also include group photos of students and sometimes even photos of faculty members, pictures of different seasons on campus and key events held that year. While graduation albums may be a special way for students to remember their university years, fewer students are signing up to be part of the album. In some extreme cases, some universities even decide not to create albums at all. A Konkuk University student takes a photo at her graduation ceremony held on Feb. 21. [YONHAP] Less demand for big graduation albums Despite the upcoming graduation season, Kangwon National University will not be printing graduation albums for its August graduates. ""Students who graduated in February did get their graduation albums made, but production of graduation albums for those who will graduate in August was canceled because too few students signed up to purchase them,"" said a spokesperson for the university. While many universities create graduation albums once a year, Kangwon National University makes albums for each semester. It's not the only school seeing less demand for graduation albums. Sun Moon University also stopped creating graduation yearbooks starting from the 2024 academic year. According to the university's announcement made last June, there was less demand as students graduated at different times due to some deferring graduation or taking semesters off. There was also a decrease in the popularity of physical albums, as many students are used to taking photos with their own cameras and keeping digital images. For instance, only 19.6 to 26.7 percent of Sun Moon University's soon-to-be graduates bought graduation albums during the past five years. The school also saw around 100 students each year pay, but later ask for refunds as they changed their minds and didn't want to purchase albums. Chungbuk National University stopped creating graduation albums starting from 2022, after only 253 out of the 2,800 graduates in 2021 actually purchased graduation albums. Chung-Ang University graduates throw their graduation caps in the air during their graduation ceremony held on Feb. 19, 2024. [YONHAP] Chung-Ang University still prints a big graduation album with all students, although the number of students purchasing them is falling. ""There were a bit less than 500 graduation albums sold last year, and the number of graduation albums sold is gradually decreasing over time,"" said a spokesperson for the university. ""However, Chung-Ang University does plan to keep making graduation albums for as long as possible."" While graduation albums are a way to look back at familiar faces and close friends, they can sometimes feature photos of complete strangers, as many graduates graduate at a different time than their peers due to taking semesters off or deferring graduation. According to Statistics Korea, 46.8 percent of 2,752 university graduates surveyed in 2024 said they took a semester or more off. Of the respondents, 74.5 percent of male students said they took time off, as many do so for mandatory military service. Of the 1,135 male students who said they took time off, 93.6 percent said they did so to serve in the military. With multiple answers allowed, another 14.4 percent said they did so to prepare for certification exams or search for jobs. Another 4.6 percent did so for exchange semesters or internships. For the remaining 1,617 female respondents, 51 percent took semesters off to prepare for certification exams or search for jobs. Another 26 percent did so for exchange semesters or to work as an intern. Deferring graduation is also common, a choice many make to maintain student status while applying for jobs or specific internships that are only open to students. According to the Ministry of Education, there were 17,939 bachelor's students who deferred graduation in 2024, which is up 17.4 percent year-on-year. ""All my friends were graduating at different times, and I just didn't see the point in taking photos for the university graduation album,"" said a 26-year-old surnamed Shin, who graduated from Yonsei University last year. ""I deferred graduation, and was working as an intern during the semester before I actually graduated, and it was also hard to take a day off from work to come take photos at the campus."" Graduation album for one While fewer universities are creating albums with the entire graduating class, this doesn't mean graduation albums are entirely gone. It's still common to see notices on university websites or the student council's social media that announce details about graduation albums. However, those are slightly different from traditional graduation albums. Rather than having an album that compiles photos of all graduates, many universities are creating albums for one or a small group of friends. A photo uploaded to Sungkyunkwan University's general student council's Instagram shows different types of graduation albums students can choose from. [SCREEN CAPTURE] Starting from the 2025 academic year, Sungkyunkwan University announced it wouldn't be creating a big graduation album that includes photos of all graduates and key faculty. Up until 2024, the university allowed students to either purchase a large graduation album with photos of all graduates, professors and the university president, or purchase a personal album with pictures of themselves. Following the change, Sungkyunkwan University students can choose from three options: creating a personal graduation album that only has photos of themselves or a select group of friends, taking individual or group pictures with friends and just getting a digital file, or just purchasing a printed photo of themselves that comes in a frame. Kyung Hee University also stopped creating albums with all graduates and faculty starting from the 2025 academic year. Like Sungkyunkwan, the university is also focusing on creating personal graduation albums. The album will be just four pages long, including the individual student's graduation portrait and a few shots taken on campus. Students who want a bigger album among friends in their department or student club can do so if they manage to gather 10 or more people, placing a custom group order. Sogang University also creates solo or group albums within select friend groups, or allows students to obtain a digital file or a print photo in a frame. Are there other ways students capture their graduation memories? Graduation albums may have lost some popularity, but students are still celebrating with photos. Many students are taking more photos, but they're of different types. Rather than sitting for a formal graduation portrait, some students now choose to hire personal photographers for customized photoshoots to upload on their social media. Booking such photoshoots, which are referred to in Korean as graduation snaps, photographers will take photos with students around campus for around an hour or two and later provide edited photos. Prices vary based on the duration of the photoshoots and the number of photos provided, ranging from 70,000 won ($50) to 250,000 won. Rather than students posing in front of a soft studio gradient background, the graduation snaps are usually taken at recognizable campus locations. For Seoul National University, its main gate, shaped like the Korean letter sha , is a popular choice. The Ewha Campus Complex of Ewha Womans University is a favorite for the university, and many students from Korea University pose near the main gate where they can use the main building as a backdrop. A student takes a graduation photoshoot at Korea University's campus in Seongbuk District, northern Seoul [KIM EUN-SOO] Kim Eun-soo, a photographer who runs MargotPic Studio located in Seodaemun District, western Seoul, has been taking photos of various graduates in the Seoul region. ""Demand for graduation photoshoots first started to grow because people couldn't have proper graduation ceremonies during the Covid-19 pandemic, but still wanted to have nice photos to remember the moment,"" said Kim. ""Then, we had universities redesign their graduation gowns to reflect school colors and identity, which also brought up the demand to take photos in the new gowns."" ""When I talk with other graduation photographers, they do say the demand for graduation photoshoots isn't as high as it used to be, but I think that's mainly because we now have more photographers that are doing the photoshoots. I think graduation photoshoots have really become a part of the graduation culture now."" Photo shoots shot using film cameras to give a vintage vibe have always been a favorite of students, with many also bringing along plush dolls of their university mascots to take photos with. Apart from photoshoots on campus, Kim also sees a growing interest in casual photos taken at the studio. One of the popular styles that graduates book is her so-called king-sized diploma photos, which she edits photos of graduates in front of an upsized diploma with the student's name and major. A photo that photographer Kim Eun-soo takes, editing a graduate's diploma in the background [KIM EUN-SOO] ""While doing a graduation photoshoot on campus, I saw that the university had set up a photo wall that was shaped like a diploma,"" said Kim. ""I thought it would be nice if students could take photos like that, but just with their own diploma, and started taking such photos."" ""A lot of people reached out to me after seeing the sample photos I uploaded to Instagram, and I got a lot of positive responses saying the idea was good."" Apart from getting a professional photoshoot, some also go for an easier option: taking a photo at one of the many photo booths out on the streets for an affordable price of around 7,000 won. While photos taken at the photo booths generally come out with a default frame, either in black or white, with a logo of the photo booth brand, companies have been making special graduation-themed frames to help people celebrate. Life4Cuts' graduation frame released in February [LIFE4CUTS] Photo booth brand Life4Cuts releases various seasonal photo booth frames, such as the cherry blossom, Christmas or summer-themed frames. A graduation-themed frame is also one of the regular designs the company releases, a tradition it has been doing every February since 2022. For this year, the brand also released a graduation frame, designed to look like Instagram's question sticker layout, with speech bubbles that have congratulatory messages for graduates. The photo frame was offered in February, and around 4,800 photos were printed using the frame. ""We plan to continue releasing the graduation frame in time for the February graduation season, and we are also considering releasing the frame around May to June and in time for the fall semester graduation season in August and September, as we are a global photo booth brand,"" said a spokesperson for Life4Cuts.

The baby was born around 3 a.m. on April 1 in a house in Sicheon-myeon, Sancheong. Although the main wildfire had been extinguished on March 30, authorities remained on high alert due to the risk of reignition. Fire crews were actively monitoring for residual embers when a radio message came through: “Baby born. Breathing and conscious. Mother breathing and conscious.” The message, sent from a house near the wildfire command center, prompted an urgent response from the Danseong special rescue team, which was on wildfire patrol duty and a mountain rescue unit returning from another call. Upon arrival, the rescue team found the mother holding her newborn, still attached by the umbilical cord. They quickly performed hypothermia prevention measures and stabilized the mother. Following medical guidance, the firefighters tied off the umbilical cord and assisted the guardian in cutting it. They also performed uterine fundal massage to help deliver the placenta and then transported the mother and baby to a nearby obstetrics clinic. “It was truly heartwarming to see the baby again, growing up healthy,” said one of the firefighters who responded to the scene. “We hope the child continues to grow strong and well.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

691,Presidential office reiterates longstanding nature of Opcon transfer talks,"President Lee Jae Myung, right, speaks with National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac, left, during a National Security Council meeting at the presidential office in Yongsan, central Seoul, on July 10, in this photo uploaded to President Lee's social media. [NEWS1] As Seoul and Washington hold package deal negotiations linking tariffs and security, questions have resurfaced over the transfer of wartime operational control (Opcon), from the United States to South Korea. The presidential office on Friday denied the issue was new or part of any active negotiation, saying, “It is a long-standing matter, not a new one.” Multiple government officials confirmed that while Opcon transfer remains a topic of bilateral discussion since the 2006 agreement, it is not currently a central agenda item. Related Article Pentagon nominee voices support for bolstering South Korea's role in alliance over Opcon transfer question Top military officers of Korea, U.S. to meet amid USFK role change speculation U.S. think tank proposes slashing USFK troop level to about 10,000 from 28,500 Still, some analysts warn that if the Trump administration returns and pushes for strategic ""flexibility,” it could open the door to revisiting U.S. troop deployments in Korea, potentially accelerating talks on Opcon transfer under the logic that South Korea should handle its own defense. Who currently holds operational control? Operational control of South Korean forces was transferred to the United Nations Command during the Korean War in 1950 and later to the commander of the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC) after its establishment in 1978. In 1994, South Korea regained peacetime control through the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but wartime operational control remains with the CFC commander. When was Opcon transfer supposed to happen? The transfer was first agreed upon in September 2006 during the Roh Moo-hyun administration. It was originally scheduled for April 17, 2012. However, rising threats from North Korea led the Lee Myung-bak administration in 2010 to delay the date to December 1, 2015. In 2014, under Park Geun-hye, Seoul and Washington agreed to reassess the timing and conditions of the transfer. In 2015, the method shifted from a time-based plan to a conditions-based framework. President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump later reaffirmed cooperation to expedite the transfer under these conditions. President Lee Jae Myung presides over a Cabinet meeting at the Yongsan presidential office in central Seoul on July 8. [PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE] What are the conditions for transfer? Three main conditions must be met: South Korea must possess the military capability to lead a combined defense, the alliance must have a comprehensive response system to North Korean nuclear and missile threats and the regional security environment must support a stable transition. These are assessed jointly by the two militaries and reported to the Military Committee Meeting (MCM) and Security Consultative Meeting (SCM), which help guide the decision by both governments on when the transfer should occur. The fact that Opcon remains with the CFC indicates that the agreed conditions have not yet been fulfilled. What is President Lee’s position? As a presidential candidate, Lee Jae Myung supported early Opcon transfer but said it must be based on meeting necessary conditions. “I said we should do it quickly, not unconditionally,” he clarified during a February 2022 debate. He also questioned why conditions were needed but ultimately acknowledged the need to follow agreed procedures. While Lee did not directly raise the issue during the 2022 presidential campaign, his party’s policy platform stated the goal of “recovering wartime operational control based on a strong Korea-U.S. alliance.” Notably, the term “recover” was used instead of the official term “transfer.” During his first National Security Council meeting since taking office, President Lee reportedly asked multiple questions about the history, concept and implications of Opcon transfer, signaling interest in the matter. President Lee Jae Myung presides over a meeting with senior secretaries at the Yongsan presidential office in central Seoul on July 10, ahead of presiding over his first National Security Council (NSC) meeting. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] Why is the transfer back in the spotlight? The current administration is linking security and tariff issues in its negotiations with the United States, raising the possibility that the transfer of Opcon could come up in discussions under the security track. “The transfer of wartime operational control is a long-term issue we’ve pursued for years, across administrations,” National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac told reporters on Wednesday, shortly after returning from Washington. “I don’t know whether it will come up in the security dialogue, but we’re not there yet.” “The transfer of Opcon has long been a matter of discussion between Korea and the United States, and it is not a new issue,” the presidential office said in a statement issued the same day. “We will continue close consultations with the United States on the matter.” President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, May 23, 2025, in Washington. [AP/YONHAP] Could the issue be brought to the negotiating table? The fact that it is not currently on the table does not preclude it from becoming a key agenda item in the future. If Seoul and Washington fail to find common ground on defense cost-sharing — the central issue in the security talks — other security matters, including Opcon transfer, could become part of a broader package deal. Washington has been pressuring Seoul, as it does NATO members, to raise its defense spending to 5 percent of GDP. Korea’s defense budget currently accounts for around 2.3 percent of GDP. When asked on Wednesday whether the Opcon issue could be part of the security consultations, Wi said, “The issues you mentioned, including defense spending, are among the topics of discussion. These talks are likely to be prolonged,” indicating the government is not ruling out that possibility.

[AP/YONHAP] What happens to U.S. Forces Korea? The Trump administration has emphasized strategic “flexibility,” seeking to reduce U.S. costs while shifting more responsibility to allies and expanding their roles in countering China. This could mean downsizing U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) or repurposing them beyond North Korea deterrence. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Pentagon is reviewing a plan to reduce the USFK presence by 4,500 troops, from the current 28,500. Dan Caldwell, former senior adviser to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, released a report on Wednesday calling for the number to be cut to around 10,000. The U.S. review of overseas military deployments and costs could lead to greater burden-sharing demands on allies. A reduced troop presence might imply that South Korea is capable of defending itself — potentially allowing the U.S. to argue that Opcon conditions have been met.

[JOONGANG ILBO] Elbridge Colby, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense, told the JoongAng Ilbo last April that South Korea should reduce its reliance on U.S. conventional forces and take the lead in its own defense. However, some experts caution that transferring Opcon without meeting the necessary conditions could weaken South Korea’s defense posture or send the wrong message to North Korea. “As recently as early this year, both Seoul and Washington agreed that several key benchmarks had not yet been met,” said a senior diplomatic source familiar with the matter. “The two sides need to engage in serious consultations, but it would be unwise to use this issue as a negotiating chip.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

692,U.S. military expert calls for expanding role of USFK to include Taiwan contingencies,"U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) armored vehicles are seen in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi, on March 10. [YONHAP] A U.S. military expert has renewed calls to expand the role of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) beyond deterring North Korea to potentially include involvement in a Taiwan contingency. The suggestion comes amid growing expectations of a trade and economic ""package deal"" between Korea and the United States — and concerns that the Donald Trump administration could use the reshaping of USFK as a bargaining chip. Related Article Korea pivots to trade with Taiwan, Vietnam as U.S. tariffs rattle foundation China, Taiwan clash over history, Beijing says can't 'invade' what is already its territory Taiwan emerges as key growth market for Korean goods amid declining exports to U.S., China The Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, on Thursday published an issue brief titled “South Korea is the Ideal Anchor for the First Island Chain” by Lt. Col. Brian Kerg of the U.S. Marine Corps. “There is no agreement, regulation or document that traps U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula,” wrote Kerg. “If the Pacific becomes a war zone, no matter the threat, the United States gets a decisive vote in how its forces are employed, whether on or off the Korean Peninsula.” Kerg noted that conflicts between “great power wars tend to expand horizontally” and that “there are many paths by which a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could lead to a North Korean attack on South Korea and vice versa.” He also said, “Should the United States defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression, South Korea will inevitably become involved.” U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) helicopters are seen at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, on April 9. [YONHAP] He emphasized the need for the United States to invest more defense assets in Korea, positioning the country as “the anchor of the first island chain” in its broader strategy to counter China. The first island chain — a conceptual line running through Okinawa, Taiwan and the Strait of Malacca — is seen by Washington as the front line for deterring the expansion of Chinese naval power. China has also drawn up the second and third island chains — which stretch from eastern Japan to Palau and from the Aleutian Islands to New Zealand, respectively — in a bid to undermine U.S. naval dominance in the Pacific. Beijing has recently expanded its reach with aircraft carrier strike groups. Kerg wrote that “investing U,S, resources in South Korean security should rightly be seen as simultaneously defending against both North Korean and Chinese aggression,” suggesting the redeployment of some U.S.-based troops to Korea. Noting that half the approximately 18,000 U.S. troops stationed in Okinawa are being relocated to Guam and Hawaii, he argued for greater U.S. investment in Korean security infrastructure.

[AP/YONHAP] Kerg added, however, that Seoul is expected to shoulder most of the financial burden, writing that “Korea, where anti-Chinese attitudes are on the rise, would likely accept the additional investment. Korea would foot much of the bill for infrastructure supporting these additional forces per the terms of the Special Measures Agreement and is likely to continue to pay for their sustainment in the future.” He also suggested the United States could stockpile essential military supplies in South Korea for use in the event of a conflict with North Korea or China, noting that Seoul would be unlikely to object even if those supplies were used in a conflict with Beijing. Lt. Col. Kerg, who serves in operations planning in the U.S. Marine Corps, authored the brief as a nonresident fellow of the Atlantic Council.

693,"1 in 5 households own 91% of private land, data shows","An aerial view of the Seoripul area in Sinwon-dong, Seocho District, southern Seoul, is pictured on Nov. 17, 2024. [YONHAP] A mere fifth of households in Korea lay claim to more than 91 percent of the country’s private land, highlighting a persistent imbalance in land ownership. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent of households hold just 0.8 percent. The findings were published in the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's report on Friday, which marked the tenth publication of such data since 2006. Related Article President Lee completes his Cabinet with new land, culture ministers picks Central bank hits pause on interest rate cuts in white hot housing market Lee blames real estate speculation for housing woes, calls for more investment vehicles Seoul housing now four times more expensive than South Jeolla, BOK report says According to the report, 38.4 percent of Koreans — about 19.64 million out of a total population of 51.22 million — owned at least some land. This represents a 43.7 percent increase compared to 2006. By household, 63.4 percent — or 15.3 million households — reported owning land. The ministry noted that both the number of individuals and households owning land “have steadily increased.” Despite more people owning land, concentration remains severe. The top 10 percent of landowning households control 78.4 percent of total privately held land, up from 76.3 percent in 2006. When expanded to the top 20 percent, this figure rises to 91.3 percent. In contrast, the bottom half of households account for a mere 0.8 percent, and the bottom 70 percent hold only 3.5 percent. Among corporations, the imbalance is even more pronounced. The top 10 percent of companies own 92.3 percent of all land held by corporate entities. Apartment complexes are seen from Mount Namsan in central Seoul on July 7. [NEWS1] Breaking down ownership by age group, people in their 60s make up the largest share of landowners at 30.2 percent, followed by those in their 50s at 21.2 percent and those in their 70s at 20.8 percent. The share of land held by individuals 60 and older jumped from 45.1 percent in 2006 to 65.6 percent last year, reflecting Korea’s aging population, longer land holding periods compared to housing, and younger generations’ continued migration to urban centers. By gender, men own 54.5 percent of land while women own 45.5 percent. The gap in the number of male and female landowners has gradually narrowed since 2006.

[YONHAP] In total land area, individuals own 46,258 square kilometers (11,430,601 acres), corporations hold 7,404 square kilometers and noncorporate entities such as family associations and religious groups own 7,823 square kilometers. Among land owned by individuals, forested land accounted for the largest share at 57.6 percent, followed by farmland at 34.4 percent and building lots at 5.8 percent. Since 2006, the share of land owned by individuals has decreased by 4.7 percent. Over the same period, land owned by corporations and noncorporate organizations rose by 35.6 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. Nationwide, 43.6 percent of landowners reside outside the area where their land is located. Seoul recorded the lowest ratio, with only 20.6 percent of landowners living outside the capital. The ministry compiled the statistics using cadastral records, including land and forest registers maintained by local governments across the country. The comprehensive data set covers 39 categories, such as ownership by gender and age, land held by nonresidents by region, and land held by individuals, corporations, and noncorporate organizations.

Dan Caine and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Yoshida pose for a photo during their meeting at JCS headquarters in Seoul on July 10. [JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] The Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the United States and Japan pledged Friday to continue working together toward the complete denuclearization of North Korea, amid discussions about a possible shift in the role and size of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK). The statement emphasized that trilateral cooperation is aimed at deterring Pyongyang.

Yoshida Yoshihide adopted a joint press statement at the 22nd Trilateral Chiefs of Defense (Tri-Chod) Meeting on July 11 in Seoul. “The defense chiefs condemned the DPRK's continued development of unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and agreed to continue coordination toward the complete denuclearization of the DPRK in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),” the statement read. DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The three military leaders “discussed the deployment of the DPRK’s troops to Russia, as well as the potential transfer of military technology from Russia to the DPRK” and “pledged to continue working together to respond to the DPRK's threats” while urging “the DPRK to immediately cease all unlawful activities to destabilize the Korean Peninsula, the Indo-Pacific and beyond.” After the meeting, the three visited the South Korean Navy’s Second Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, to pay tribute to the 46 sailors who died in the 2010 sinking of the Cheonan warship, which was caused by a surprise torpedo attack by the North.

That policy was expected to apply to overseas U.S. military operations, potentially affecting the size and mission of USFK. The joint statement reaffirms that the trilateral alliance’s top priority remains countering the North’s nuclear and missile threats. Although China was not explicitly mentioned in the statement, the leaders noted that trilateral cooperation “has played a key role in promoting peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific,” and that they “focused on various ways to deepen their cooperation in order to ensure peace and stability in the region” — an apparent reference to China’s rising military presence. Meanwhile, the three countries conducted a joint aerial drill south of Jeju Island on Friday, involving the deployment of a U.S. B-52H strategic bomber to the Korean Peninsula for the first time this year. South Korea’s KF-16 fighter jets and Japan’s F-2 fighters also participated. The Korean military said the exercise was “aimed at enhancing the three countries’ deterrence and response capabilities against North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated nuclear and missile threats,” and added that the allies will “continue trilateral training and cooperation to jointly deter and respond to threats from North Korea.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

698,Chae Hwi-young's nomination as culture minister signals big tourism push,"Culture Minister nominee Chae Hwi-young [TRIPLE] President Lee Jae Myung on Friday nominated Chae Hwi-young, co-CEO of one of the largest online travel platforms in Korea, as the minister of culture, sports and tourism in an apparent bid to accelerate the country's drive toward a larger tourism market with the help of entertainment and content. Chae, aged 61, is a seasoned professional with over two decades of experience in the digital platform industry and is the first nominee from the tourism industry to head the ministry. The only prior appointee with a similar background was Kim Jong-min, who served from 2007 to 2008 after leading the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) and serving as vice minister of culture. Related Article President Lee completes his Cabinet with new land, culture ministers picks KCC chief booted from Cabinet meetings for 'politically biased remarks' Cabinet nominees cite hearings, avoid explaining controversies Born in Busan in 1964, Chae graduated from Gyeongseong High School and earned a degree in English literature from Sogang University in 1990. He began his career as a journalist at Yonhap News Agency and YTN before moving into tech, joining Yahoo Korea in 2000 and later NHN in 2002, where he served as head of planning at the Naver division and eventually as CEO. In 2016, he founded Triple, a hyper-personalized travel platform that recommends itineraries based on users’ travel histories. The app was acquired by Yanolja in 2022 and merged with Interpark to form Interpark Triple, where Chae became CEO. Chae currently coleads Nol Universe, one of Korea’s largest travel platforms launched late last year. The company integrates Yanolja Platform, Korea’s top accommodation booking service; Interpark, a leader in flight and concert ticket sales; and Triple, known for its customized travel recommendations. Chae is the latest Naver alumnus to be tapped for a key government post under Lee’s administration, following Han Seong-sook, the nominee for SMEs and Startups Minister, and Ha Jung-woo, senior secretary for future AI planning. He is also the second Sogang University graduate to be nominated to a Cabinet post, following the late former Defense Minister Kim Tae-young. “He brings a wealth of experience across sectors, from journalism and leading an online portal to founding a travel platform,"" Presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said of Chae during a press briefing on Friday. Kang described Chae as “a new CEO for the Culture Ministry, poised to realize the president’s vision of building a 300 trillion-won [$218.2 billion] K-culture market, with private-sector expertise and fresh ideas.” Cultural experts see the nomination as a signal of the administration’s focus on transforming the ministry into an engine for Korea’s content industries, especially tourism and entertainment. Triple surpassed 5.5 million cumulative users just two and a half years after its launch, and the sector hopes Chae can lead Korea into a new era of 20 million annual inbound tourists. “Chae is known internally as a leader with both insight and execution,” said a Yanolja official. “He has long stressed that the success of K-content can drive added value across various sectors, including inbound tourism.” Korea saw 16.96 million foreign visitors last year — just below the pre-pandemic level of 17.5 million — with nearly 80 percent concentrated in the Seoul metropolitan area, according to the KTO. The ministerial nomination is also expected to accelerate the appointment of a new KTO president, a post that has remained vacant for 18 months since Kim Jang-sil stepped down in January 2023 to run for office. Chae’s nomination has also sparked calls to revise the outdated Tourism Promotion Act, which critics say fails to recognize travel tech firms like Yanolja, Airbnb and Klook. “The act should be comprehensively revised to accommodate new industries like travel tech and unlock the full growth potential of Korea’s tourism sector,” said Lee Hoon, a professor at Hanyang University’s Graduate School of Tourism.

699,Samsung Biologics employee sentenced to three years for stealing confidential documents,"Bottles of pharmaceutical products are displayed at the Samsung Biologics promotion center in Yeonsu District, Incheon, on May 25, 2021. [YONHAP] A former Samsung Biologics employee was sentenced to three years in prison for illegally taking company documents that included ""national core technologies"" in biotechnology. The court immediately remanded the former worker into custody. The Incheon District Court’s Criminal Division 5 found the 46-year-old former employee guilty of violating the Industrial Technology Protection Act and other laws, according to legal insiders on Friday. Related Article Samsung Biologics sees big things ahead with spin-off, CDMO momentum and new anti-cancer drugs Samsung Biologics to split into manufacturing and development units U.S. FDA conducting inspection at Samsung Biologics facilities in Korea “Given the large volume of materials the defendant misappropriated and the fact that they included national core technologies in biotechnology, a prison sentence is unavoidable,” the judge said. Prosecutors had earlier sought a five-year prison term during closing arguments. The former employee allegedly spent about 10 days in early December 2022 extracting 175 sets of confidential company documents, including standard operating procedures (SOP), totaling some 3,700 pages. On Dec. 13 of that year, security staff caught the worker trying to carry roughly 300 printed pages of trade secrets out of Samsung Biologics’ headquarters in Songdo, Incheon. Police arrested the suspect on the spot. Investigators said the stolen documents contained two categories of national core technologies: IT SOPs and analyses of regulatory guidelines from various countries. These are critical to maintaining the quality competitiveness of mass production processes for biopharmaceuticals. Following the verdict, Samsung Biologics stressed the importance of safeguarding its intellectual property. “The technologies we’ve accumulated through the efforts of countless employees are the company’s core assets,” the company said. “We will continue to respond vigorously to any attempts to leak trade secrets or national core technologies.” Industry experts noted the significance of the ruling. “This is a landmark case where a court recognized the theft of core technologies in the bio sector, following similar cases in semiconductors and displays,” one industry insider said. “It’s likely to influence how courts handle similar disputes going forward.” The ruling comes amid other ongoing cases involving Samsung Biologics. In June 2022, a former employee who got a job at Lotte Biologics was indicted for allegedly stealing 49 files, including SOPs. That case is still going through the courts.

[JOINT PRESS CORPS] Former President Yoon Suk Yeol refused to comply with his first summons for questioning by the special counsel team on Friday, a day after he was taken back into custody. The special counsel investigating the alleged insurrection announced that Yoon failed to appear for the scheduled questioning Friday afternoon. This marks the former president’s first noncompliance since his re-arrest. The special counsel said it is now considering forcible summons measures.

The document cited only “health reasons,” without further elaboration. The special counsel said it will verify whether Yoon is indeed in such poor health that he cannot participate in the investigation. “We have requested that the detention center confirm whether any health issues were identified during the intake medical check and monitoring process that would prevent his attendance,” Park said. “If the absence is deemed legitimate, we will respect that. Otherwise, we will proceed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act,” she added. “Detention includes both custody and compulsory appearance, and we will take the next steps as needed.” Former President Yoon Suk Yeol leaves the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul after the pretrial detention hearing on July 9.

Park also said the special counsel does not plan to question Yoon inside the Seoul Detention Center. “The principle is to conduct summons-based investigations,” Park said. “Yoon has appeared in public for trials and Constitutional Court proceedings, so his case differs from past examples such as Park Geun-hye’s, who was questioned in detention in 2017.” Former President Yoon Suk Yeol heads to Seoul Detention Center on July 9 after completing his second pretrial detention hearing at the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho District, southern Seoul. [YONHAP] Given the number of allegations to investigate, the team is considering issuing another summons over the weekend. In addition to the abuse of power and obstruction of duty charges cited in Yoon’s arrest warrant, prosecutors plan to question him about the motivation, planning and declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. Yoon also refused to attend questioning when he was first arrested by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials in January. Despite attempts at forced appearance and on-site questioning, he cited health issues and legal consultations to avoid participation. Yoon is currently being held in a solitary cell measuring just over 6.61 square meters (71.14 square feet) at the Seoul Detention Center, wearing a light brown uniform marked with inmate number 3617. His legal team is reportedly considering filing a habeas corpus request to contest the legality and necessity of his detention. “We are still discussing whether to request a detention review,” a lawyer for Yoon said.

701,"Nearly 40% of 1,000 top exporters expect business to worsen with tariffs","Cargo waiting to be exported at the Pyeongtaek Port in Gyeonggi on June 30 [YONHAP] Korea's export outlook isn't so great for the latter half of the year. Korean companies, quite unsurprisingly, cite U.S. tariffs as the biggest threat. The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) said Friday that more than half of the top 1,000 companies by revenue in 10 key export industries, or 53.3 percent, selected tariff policies under the Donald Trump administration as the biggest export risk in the second half of the year. Related Article Trump puts 35 percent tariff on Canada, eyes 15-20 percent tariffs for others Trump tariff pressure campaign takes hard-line shift with copper in the crosshairs Seoul shares hit near 4-year high despite Trump's renewed tariff threats Other major concerns included ""sluggish demand due to low global growth"" at 14 percent and ""intensifying trade tensions between the United States and China"" at 12.7 percent. A striking 92 percent of companies said a U.S. tariff increase of more than 15 percent would be ""difficult to endure."" Even if the rate remains below 10 percent, 42 percent said it would still pose a serious burden. The federation warned that if the 25 percent reciprocal tariffs proposed by the White House take effect on Aug. 1 as scheduled, Korean exporters will face significantly greater difficulties. To respond to higher tariffs, 33.7 percent of companies pointed to cost-cutting measures, 33.2 percent indicated adjustments in export prices and 14.7 percent cited expanded overseas production. Another 14.2 percent said they have no clear countermeasure in place. About 38.7 percent of respondents said they expect profitability from exports to worsen in the second half, while only 14 percent anticipated improvement. The remaining 47.3 percent said it would remain similar to the same period last year. By industry, the outlook for export profitability was more negative than positive in seven sectors, including auto parts, automobiles, general machinery, petrochemicals and steel. Only two sectors — semiconductors and shipbuilding — had more companies forecasting improved profitability. Cargo waiting to be exported at the Pyeongtaek Port in Gyeonggi on July 1 [YONHAP] The main causes cited for worsening profitability included higher costs from tariffs at 44.8 percent, falling export prices due to tougher competition at 34.5 percent and rising labor and operational costs at 13.8 percent. “The ongoing pressure from U.S. tariffs and weak global demand means short-term cost-saving measures are not enough,” said Lee Sang-ho, head of FKI's Economic and Industrial Research Department, stressing the need for trade agreements ""that reflect Korea’s export strengths, as well as efforts to diversify export markets and strengthen export competitiveness."" A separate survey released Friday by the Korea International Trade Association of more than 400 trade industry professionals found that the top economic and trade pledge the new administration should prioritize is the implementation of a strategic trade policy aimed at maximizing national interests and strengthening industrial competitiveness, chosen by 20.7 percent of respondents. The answer was followed by diversifying export items and markets at 20.3 percent, and helping domestic small and mid-sized businesses begin exporting at 18.1 percent. A total of 43.3 percent of respondents said they expect exports to decline by more than 5 percent this year compared to last year. Just 17.8 percent expect an increase. A total of 71.1 percent said they believe exports will not begin to recover until next year or later. Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

702,"'S Line': Murder, mystery and red threads of intimate fate","A still from the Wavve original series “S Line” [WAVVE] A crimson thread appears above the heads of those who have had a sexual relationship. When one of the connected individuals dies, the thread vanishes. This is the eerie premise behind “S Line,” a webtoon by author Kkomabi, who also penned the original story behind the Netflix original series “A Killer Paradox” (2024). In this world, the most private of secrets — who has slept with whom — are laid bare. Related Article Tving and Wavve launch joint ‘Double Pass’ subscription ahead of merger FTC conditionally approves Tving, Wavve merger, fees to remain unchanged until end of 2026 Korean copyright association files suit against Wavve over unauthorized use of music “S Line” returns as an original series on streaming platform Wavve, but with a twist. Unlike the original, which begins when all of humanity suddenly starts seeing the threads, the drama shifts the focus to a few characters who have the special ability to see them. Hyun-heup, played by Arin, a high school student, has seen the threads since birth. Others gain the ability through special glasses. Most people, however, remain unaware of the threads. Kkomabi said that Wavve's version expands the universe of the original story with new episodes and characters. “It was fascinating to experience the drama’s unique charm,” they added. The series opens with Hyun-heup’s narration: “There are things in life that don’t need to be seen — no, things that mustn’t be seen. I have seen these lines since I was born.” Believing that her ability caused a tragedy in her family, Hyun-heup isolates herself. A still from the Wavve original series “S Line” [WAVVE] One day, she witnesses a murder in her neighborhood. Suspecting a connection to the mysterious lines, she leaves the house. She then encounters glasses that allow the wearer to see the threads, just like she does. The story grows increasingly complex as she becomes involved with Detective Han Ji-wook, played by Lee Soo-hyuk, who is investigating the murder, and a mysterious teacher Lee Gyu-jin, played by Lee Da-hee, who has no threads at all. The drama had its world premiere at the Grand Lumiere Theater during the 8th Cannes International Series Festival in May, where it was invited to compete in the long-form series category. “S Line” also took home the Best Music award in its category — the first time a Korean production has earned that distinction at Canneseries. The score was directed by composer Lee Jun-oh, known for his work on films “The Terror, Live” (2013) and “Little Forest” (2018) and the Tving period drama series “Queen Woo” (2024). From left: Actors Lee Da-hee, Arin, director Ahn Joo-young and actors Lee Eun-saem and Lee Soo-hyuk pose at CGV Yongsan I’Park Mall on July 7. [WAVVE] Arin, a member of girl group Oh My Girl and an actress who has built her filmography through series like “Girl’s World” (2020) and “Alchemy of Souls” (2022), takes on a dramatically different role in “S Line.” “When I first met Arin, I saw a determination in her to throw herself into the character, even into fire if necessary,” said director Ahn Joo-young at a press conference held at CGV Yongsan in central Seoul on Monday. “I felt like we could do anything together.” “I thought, if not this work, when would I get to attempt something like this?” said Arin. “I really tried to show a different side of myself.” Director Ahn Joo-young speaks at CGV Yongsan I’Park Mall on July 7. [YONHAP] Director Ahn, known for her 2018 indie feature “A Boy and Sungreen,” which portrayed youth in a non-stereotypical way, makes her fantasy-thriller debut with “S Line.” “It feels surreal to win an award with a music director I’ve worked with since my short film days,” she said at the press event. “Each episode has a slightly different concept, so we tailored the tone with variations in instrumentation.” “I love the original, but I couldn’t include every episode,” Ahn said. “At its core, 'S Line' is about people. I tried to show how individuals change through the existence of the line.” “S Line” consists of six episodes, with the first two released on Wavve on Friday. Two new episodes will be released each week. Viewer discretion is advised due to scenes depicting self-harm and suicide.

704,Special counsel investigates Kim Keon Hee's ties to IMS Mobility amid financial misconduct allegations,"Former first lady Kim Keon Hee walks into Acrovista, the apartment complex to which she and former President Yoon Suk Yeol moved to following Yoon's impeachment, on April 11. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] A special counsel investigation is zeroing in on the former first lady Kim Keon Hee's alleged connection to a little-known tech firm, raising suspicions of influence peddling and covert financial gains. The special counsel team investigating Kim Keon Hee, led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, is expanding its probe into IMS Mobility, formerly known as BeMyCar, a company allegedly linked to Kim Ye-seong, an associate of the former first lady. Related Article Special counsel raids police, lawmakers in ex-first lady probe Sambu Construction raided in probe into ex-first lady Travel ban imposed on former first lady Kim Keon Hee Kim Ye-seong was convicted for his involvement in forging a bank balance certificate for Kim Keon Hee’s mother, Choi Eun-soon, earning him the moniker of ""Kim Keon Hee's butler."" IMS Mobility reportedly received a total of 18.4 billion won ($13.3 million) in investments from firms Kakao Mobility, HS Hyosung and Korea Securities Finance Corporation. Investigators found that about half of that sum — roughly 9.2 billion won — was spent on ""outsourced services,"" raising suspicions of potential financial misconduct. The company, however, claims the transactions were internal and no funds left the corporate group. Kim Keon Hee, wife of Former President Yoon Suk Yeol, waits in line to vote at a voting booth in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on June 3. [NEWS1] From zero to 9.2 billion IMS Mobility recorded 9.2 billion won in outsourcing expenses in 2023, according to JoongAng Ilbo’s investigation as of Thursday. That figure was a mere 200 million won in 2021 and zero in 2022. The company’s audit report shows total operating costs for 2023, including wages, rent and commissions, amounted to 57.5 billion won. The year 2023 was also when IMS Mobility secured 18.4 billion won in investments. The sudden spike in outsourcing costs after the capital injection raised suspicions within the special counsel team. The special counsel suspects Kim Ye-seong may have profited not only by selling shares during the investment round but also by routing funds through outsourced services. “Based on the financial statements at the time, it was hard to believe these were ordinary outsourcing transactions,” said a capital market insider, speaking on condition of anonymity. In January 2023, just before receiving the investments, IMS Mobility’s assets totaled 55.6 billion won while its liabilities stood at 141.4 billion won — effectively in a state of capital impairment. Kim Keon Hee, wife of former president Yoon Suk Yeol, leaves the official residence in Hannam-dong in Yongsan District, central Seoul, on April 11. [YONHAP] Big tech in the crosshairs Kakao Mobility invested 3 billion won and HS Hyosung injected 3.5 billion won into IMS Mobility through four subsidiaries. At the time, Kakao Mobility was under scrutiny by the Financial Supervisory Service and Korea Fair Trade Commission for accounting fraud and collusion. The special counsel team suspects the investments may have been a way to curry favor with the former first lady. The former first lady herself once served as an executive at BeMyCar, IMS Mobility’s predecessor. Kim Ye-seong reportedly earned 4.6 billion won by selling his shares following the investment. He served as an auditor at Covana Contents, a company linked to Kim Keon Hee. The prosecution requested search warrants for IMS Mobility and its affiliates on Monday, citing the possibility that Kim Keon Hee may have had undisclosed shares in the company and profited through them. However, the court denied the requests, ruling the case fell outside the scope of the special counsel’s mandate. “We have worked with IMS Mobility since 2021 in the car rental brokerage business,” said Kakao Mobility. “The investment was a business decision made as our partnership deepened.” “We followed due diligence and found the business model promising,” said HS Hyosung. Kim Keon Hee, left, wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, right, line up to vote for the presidential election on June 3. [NEWS1] Companies deny political motives IMS Mobility previously explained that the 9.2 billion won in outsourced service fees in 2023 was “probably accounted for as labor costs for affiliated company employees during the development of an online platform related to the rental car business,” and added, “At the peak of development, we were spending up to 900 million won per month.” “Some of the fees may have been recorded as repayments of inter-affiliate loans,” said the company. “These were internal transactions, and no money was leaked outside.” “Kim Ye-seong left the company in 2021,” IMS Mobility said, regarding the allegations of corporate favoritism. “We hope the special counsel’s investigation will clear up political misunderstandings.” IMS Mobility flipped their original statement on Friday that the 9.2 billion won included delivery fees for transporting used cars nationwide. “We paid 60,000 to 70,000 won per delivery,” the company said, adding the absence of outsourcing costs in earlier years was due to different accounting practices before consolidated financial statements were introduced.

[JOINT PRESS CORPS] Probe to continue despite setback With the court rejecting its search warrants, the special counsel will continue its probe through voluntary cooperation.

[INCHEON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORPORATION] Incheon International Airport has launched a new cargo route to the Americas via Hawaii, aiming to slash transit times and shipping costs for Korean exporters. Incheon International Airport Corporation announced Friday it developed the “Aloha Express,” a new transshipment route that moves cargo from Incheon to the U.S. mainland through Honolulu. Related Article Incheon International Airport ranks 3rd globally for passenger numbers in 2024: Report International air passengers reach record high in first half Gadeok Airport project regains altitude under new administration The initiative is designed to strengthen air cargo connectivity with the critical North American market. The service uses Air Premia’s direct passenger flight from Incheon to Honolulu, which began operating in July. Alongside travelers, the airline transports freight as belly cargo to Hawaii. Once in Honolulu, the shipments transfer to Amazon Air’s extensive fleet, reaching 45 major cargo hubs across the U.S. mainland in a streamlined process. The first shipment departed Incheon on Wednesday. Rising demand for Korean food products and cultural content in the United States has driven up air cargo volumes from Korea, particularly for business-to-consumer e-commerce. However, peak seasons often bring shortages on Korea-U.S. cargo routes, forcing exporters to grapple with higher freight rates and delays. By adding this new transshipment line, the airport authority expects to ease these burdens for local exporters and bolster Incheon’s cargo network to the Americas. Hawaii’s proximity to Asia also offers clear logistical advantages. With a flight time of just eight hours from Incheon to Honolulu, the route could reduce total delivery times and costs by more than 20 percent compared to traditional airfreight options, depending on the final U.S. destination. Incheon International Airport projects that the new service will create an additional 12,000 tons of Asia-U.S. transshipment cargo capacity annually. “Even as geopolitical risks escalate, we will keep creating new cargo routes and uncovering demand to secure Incheon Airport’s unique competitiveness as a global logistics hub,” said Incheon International Airport Corporation President Lee Hak-jae.

708,A bigger pest than the lovebugs? Korea ups warning against white moths.,"The fall webworm, known in Korea as the American white moth [NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOREST SCIENCE] Could Korea soon be grappling with an insect as troublesome as the lovebug? Perhaps, as rising temperatures fuel the spread of the fall webworm — known locally as the American white moth. The Korea Forest Service’s National Institute of Forest Science raised its alert level on Thursday for the pest from “attention” to “caution,” warning of mounting risks tied to climate change. Related Article Environment Ministry carries out lovebug control operation on Mount Gyeyang in Incheon As climate changes, lovebug swarms are likely new normal War on mosquitoes kicks off as Seoul districts launch pest control programs The American white moth, believed to have arrived from North America in the 1950s, has now spread across the Korean Peninsula, sparing only Jeju Island. Its caterpillars appear two to three times a year, chewing through more than 200 types of plants. Large outbreaks not only damage urban landscapes but also disrupt daily life. Contact with the larvae can trigger allergic reactions, such as rashes and stinging sensations. The agency recently analyzed first-generation monitoring data from 1,600 broad-leaved trees across 32 fixed survey sites nationwide. It expects second-generation caterpillar damage to surpass previous years. An insect generation refers to a full life cycle from egg to larva, pupa and finally adult, which then lays eggs to begin the cycle anew. Based on this year’s first-generation data, the anticipated damage rate is 15.8 percent from the first round of larvae and 26.9 percent from the second round. These figures are higher than the 8.9 percent average recorded in the 2000s and the 6.7 percent in the 2010s. The researchers attributed the spike to climate change. Higher temperatures in spring and fall have extended the insects' active seasons in spring and fall, leading to a greater likelihood of a third generation emerging. Officials emphasized the need for intensified monitoring and control measures between mid-July and early August, when the second generation of larvae begins to hatch. “This is the critical window to curb damage that typically peaks in summer and autumn,” the agency said.

[YONHAP] SK Telecom (SKT) is continuing to suffer from a customer exodus, with numbers rising rapidly, especially after it promised to waive contract termination fees for everyone in response to a recent cybersecurity incident. A total of 17,376 SKT subscribers switched to rival carriers on Thursday, according to the telecom industry on Friday. Of these, 8,915 moved to KT and 8,461 to LG U+. Related Article SKT responds to gov't order with termination fee waiver service SKT ordered to waive termination fees over data breach Over 660,000 mobile carrier subscriptions switched in June amid SKT breach incident In contrast, only 10,720 subscribers switched to SKT from KT and LG U+, resulting in a net loss of 6,656 subscribers in just one day. Since Saturday, when SKT began waiving early termination fees, the company has averaged over 10,000 daily subscriber losses, with the exception of Sunday. The cumulative number of subscribers who left SKT between Saturday to Thursday has reached 75,214, with a net outflow of 28,566. Industry experts attribute the mass exodus directly to the waiver of termination fees and expect the upward trend in number portability to continue until the policy expires on Monday. The spike in number changes has intensified marketing competition among telecom providers. SKT has filed a complaint with the Korea Communications Commission, accusing KT of illegal subsidies and aggressive promotional tactics.

711,Watermelon for Kosuni: Daegu zoo's inhabitants beat the heat with shade and refreshing treats,"Kosuni, a 56-year-old female elephant at Dalseong Park Zoo in Daegu, eats frozen watermelon in her enclosure on July 9. [NEWS1] It's not just humans battling the heat. As Korea blazes, even vultures seek out scraps of shade. A relentless heat wave has blanketed Daegu since last month, earning the southeastern city once again its nickname “Daefrica,” a mashup of Daegu and Africa. The scorching weather shows little sign of easing, and at the Dalseong Park Zoo, animals are waging their own fight against the oppressive temperatures — cooling off with ice treats, showers and summer menus tailored by zookeepers. Related Article From pain to rain: Heat wave expected to break on Sunday with return of downpours Number of heat-related patients surges at record pace amid extreme heat wave Livestock deaths skyrocket as record heat wave broils Korea On Wednesday afternoon, with temperatures soaring past 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees Fahrenheit), Kosuni, a female elephant, lumbered out of her pen toward a showerhead in the outdoor enclosure. She stood under the stream for a long while to cool her back, then munched on watermelon offered by a keeper. She even crushed frozen sugarcane with her feet, patiently waiting for the sweetness to seep out. Kosuni, born in 1969, came to Dalseong Park Zoo in 2018. Each summer, she had endured Daegu’s brutal heat alongside Bokdeongi, the zoo’s long-term resident male elephant. But Bokdeongi died in 2023 at the age of 50. “Kosuni's pen does have an air conditioner, but it’s small, so she often comes out several times a day for showers to stave off the heat,” a keeper explained. Kosuni, a 56-year-old female elephant at Dalseong Park Zoo in Daegu, eats frozen watermelon in her enclosure on July 9. [NEWS1] Opened in 1970, Dalseong Park Zoo is home to 331 animals across 67 species. With the heat arriving earlier than usual, the zoo’s 10 keepers and two kitchen staff began preparing special summer menus at the end of June. They’ve tailored the treats to each animal’s preferences and health needs. Three tigers and two lions dine on pork liver and tenderloin, parrots nibble on chicory and melon seeds, while chimpanzees receive frozen tropical fruits and cucumbers. On that same sweltering afternoon, a brown bear born in 2004 lounged in a pool, chomping on frozen fruit. A chimpanzee eats frozen fruit in its enclosure at Dalseong Park Zoo in Daegu on July 9. [SONG BONG-GEUN] Nearby, Alex, a female chimpanzee born in 1987, seemed listless despite receiving her special snack. When visitors approached her enclosure, she perked up and ambled over. “It’s been so hot lately that we’ve had almost no visitors. She might be more interested in people than her treats,” a keeper said with a laugh. Alex happily munched on cucumbers and melons frozen with sports drinks and water, then locked eyes with spectators, showing off a few playful antics. Fifteen sika deer huddled under sprinklers to beat the heat, occasionally nibbling on watermelon pieces floating in shallow pools. The enclosures of vultures, white-tailed eagles and turkeys all had extra shade screens to keep out the sun.

[SONG BONG-GEUN] During the summer, keepers at Dalseong Park Zoo start each morning by checking the animals’ droppings and breathing for signs of stress or illness. They also clean and disinfect the enclosures twice daily to prevent disease and keep odors in check. For animals housed indoors, temperatures are maintained between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius. “Because the heat came early this year, we began offering special treats and showers at the end of June, paying extra attention to their well-being,” a zoo official said.

[YONHAP] Run by the city of Daegu, Dalseong Park Zoo has been a local landmark for 55 years. But because it sits within the historic Dalseong Fortress — designated as a historic site in 1963 — the entire area is under cultural heritage protection, limiting any major redevelopment. As facilities have aged, Daegu plans to relocate the zoo by 2027 to a new, environmentally friendly site at Daegu Grand Park in Suseong District. “We hope the animals stay healthy here until they move and that they can greet Daegu residents again in a better environment with improved facilities,” said Lee Jong-young, 53, head zookeeper.

712,"Sunny side up, with a helping of salmonella","A researcher at the Gyeonggi Province Institute of Health and Environment demonstrates the process of culturing and isolating food poisoning bacteria in Suwon, Gyeonggi, on May 19. [YONHAP] Health authorities are urging strict hygiene practices to prevent salmonella food poisoning, especially when handling eggs and other easily contaminated foods, as scorching temperatures persist across Korea. Data from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety on Friday indicated that warmer months consistently see a rise in infections. Related Article 10 power outages in a day: Heat wave strikes Seoul's poor in urban jjokbang villages From pain to rain: Heat wave expected to break on Sunday with return of downpours Number of heat-related patients surges at record pace amid extreme heat wave KDCA warns about salmonella as infections spike with hotter-than-average weather Between 2020 and 2024 — with last year’s figures still subject to revision — there were 204 documented outbreaks of salmonella across the country, affecting 7,788 people. More than half the cases occurred during the three hottest months from July through September. Restaurants accounted for the bulk of cases, making up 63 percent of the outbreak locations. The most common culprits were egg-based dishes such as rolled omelets and fried egg strips, along with mixed foods like gimbap (seaweed rice rolls) and lunch boxes. Monthly salmonella food poisoning cases from 2020 to 2024 show a clear spike in the summer months of July to September, according to data from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. [MINISTRY OF FOOD AND DRUG SAFETY] Salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that lives in the digestive tracts of poultry and mammals and can also be found in water and soil. When people consume food contaminated with the bacteria, they can develop symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Experts stress the importance of carefully handling and storing eggs. Often linked to salmonella, eggs should be refrigerated immediately after purchase and kept separate from other ingredients. Restaurants and cafeterias are advised not to leave them at room temperature for extended periods. Eggs are refrigerated at a supermarket in Seoul on July 2. [NEWS1] Proper hand hygiene is another key line of defense. Food handlers are urged to wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 30 seconds after touching eggs or raw meat. Failing to do so before preparing other foods or handling kitchen tools increases the risk of cross-contamination. Salmonella is sensitive to heat, making proper cooking an effective safeguard. Meat and eggs should be heated to an internal temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius (167 degrees Fahrenheit) for one minute. Eggs, in particular, should be cooked until both the yolk and white are firm. Prepared foods should ideally be eaten within two hours. If they are not consumed right away, they should be refrigerated and thoroughly reheated later. For picnics and outdoor activities, eggs and egg-based dishes should be stored in a cooler at temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius. The ministry also advised restaurants and cafeterias to keep employees who show symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea away from food preparation. Even after symptoms subside, those workers should remain out of the kitchen for another two to three days. When preparing dishes like gimbap that involve multiple ingredients, changing disposable gloves frequently can help reduce the risk of contamination.

713,HYBE chairman a no-show for second time in Kakao founder's stock manipulation trial,"Founder and chairman of HYBE Bang Si-hyuk [NEWS1] Bang Si-hyuk, founder and chairman of HYBE, has again failed to appear as a witness in the stock manipulation trial concerning SM Entertainment. Bang was scheduled to testify on Friday in a hearing at the Seoul Southern District Court for a case involving Kim Beom-su, founder of Kakao, and others accused of violating the Capital Markets Act when Kakao acquired a majority stake in SM Entertainment in 2023. Related Article Financial watchdog questions HYBE Chairman Bang Si-hyuk over IPO delay Prosecutors reject second police request to raid HYBE in Bang Si-hyuk market violation probe HYBE Chairman Bang accused of pocketing $285 million in 'undisclosed' deal However, Bang did not attend, citing a business trip to the United States. He had submitted a similar reason for his absence at the June 20 hearing. Prosecutors criticized Bang’s repeated nonappearance, asserting that he had no justifiable reason to avoid testifying and requested that the court reschedule the witness examination and impose a fine. Nevertheless, the court denied the request. “While we understand the prosecution’s stance, based on the evidence collected so far, it does not appear that Bang’s testimony is essential to reaching a judgment in this case,” the court stated, canceling Bang’s witness summons. Kim is accused of conspiring with private equity firm One Asia Partners and others to manipulate SM Entertainment’s stock price during HYBE’s tender offer in February 2023. The prosecution alleges that the share price was deliberately inflated above HYBE’s offer price of 120,000 won ($87) to obstruct the acquisition. Authorities are particularly interested in a meeting between Kim and Bang on Feb. 14, 2023. They believe Bang asked Kim to refrain from joining the battle over SM’s management rights — a request that Kim, who intended to acquire SM, allegedly declined. The final trial will take place on Aug. 29, which will include the prosecution’s request for sentence, the defense attorney’s final argument and the defendant’s final statement. This time, the defendant will also question Kim. Usually, the sentence is given one month after the final trial, but because the case carries weight, the court may take more time to reach a conclusion.

715,Hyundai and Kia haven't raised their U.S. prices yet. Can that last?,"A car carrier transporting vehicles made by Kia, which is part of Hyundai Motor, arrives at Pyeongtaek Port in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, April 15. [REUTERS/YONHAP] Hyundai Motor and Kia are holding the line on prices in the United States, choosing to wait out trade uncertainty as the clock ticks on crucial tariff negotiations between Seoul and Washington. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump postponed a planned round of reciprocal tariffs by about three weeks, setting a new deadline of Aug. 1. That extension gives Korea and the United States more time to negotiate, but it also creates a tense window during which the U.S. auto industry is ramping up aggressive promotions to seize market share. Related Article Trump tariff pressure campaign takes hard-line shift with copper in the crosshairs Trump says steep copper tariffs in store as he broadens his trade war Trump tariffs pushed to Aug. 1, granting Korea crucial negotiating window Hyundai, Kia cars discounted in some countries to fend off sluggish sales As of Wednesday, Hyundai and Kia have not announced any price hikes. Back in April, immediately after Washington slapped a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, the two automakers pledged to keep U.S. prices steady through July 8. That deadline has come and gone with no new guidance from either company. Japanese automakers have already cracked under pressure. Toyota Motor raised its U.S. vehicle prices by an average of $270 on July 1. Mitsubishi Motors bumped prices by $525 to $735 starting in June, and Subaru pushed prices up by as much as $2,055. But for now, Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America told Automotive News on July 1 that maintaining reasonable price points is crucial to navigating what’s shaping up to be a tough second half of the year. CEO of Hyundai and Genesis North America Randy Parker speaks at the Hyundai presentation during the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center in New York on April 16. [EPA/YONHAP] Industry experts say Hyundai and Kia are taking their time for good reason. “A sudden jump in prices would directly hit sales, so they’re carefully weighing the direction of tariff talks and other factors before making any decision,” said Kwon Yong-joo, a professor of automotive transport design at Kookmin University. A breakthrough on itemized tariffs for Korean-made vehicles could ease the pressure considerably. The industry hopes Washington will cut tariffs on Korean cars from 25 percent to 10 percent. Officially, the United States maintains that reciprocal tariffs and sector-specific tariffs are separate matters not up for negotiation. But industry insiders see room to maneuver depending on how talks unfold. If negotiations stall or collapse there’s a risk that rates could rise. Even as they hold out, Hyundai and Kia face steep cost pressures. The typical export of a 40 million won ($29,200) vehicle to the United States carries a tariff of around 10 million won. Based on Hyundai and Kia’s combined U.S. exports of nearly 78,000 units in May alone, that translates to roughly 778.9 billion won in tariffs for the month. The logo of Hyundai Motor is pictured at Pyeongtaek Port in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, on April 15.  [REUTERS/YONHAP] Hanwha Investment & Securities estimates that the two automakers’ total tariff burden this year will reach 4.9 trillion won, equivalent to 34.4 percent of Hyundai Motor Group’s operating profit last year. While Hyundai and Kia weigh their next steps, U.S. rivals aren’t standing still. Ford Motor on Tuesday launched a new promotion offering 48-month zero-interest financing on all models sold in the United States. The deal requires no down payment and lets buyers defer principal and interest payments for the first 90 days. Earlier this year, from April 3 to Monday, Ford sold cars at employee pricing and grew second quarter sales by 14.4 percent from a year earlier. Hyundai and Kia have also slipped to third place in the U.S. electric vehicle market with a 7.6 percent share in the first half, behind General Motors at 13.3 percent. “Ford, which ranked third in U.S. market share last year, is playing up its status as an ‘American company’ to fend off Hyundai and Kia, which were fourth,” said Cho Chul, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. “If that 25 percent tariff becomes a long-term fixture, Hyundai and Kia will have to quickly rethink their local manufacturing and parts supply chains.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

[NEWS1] Lawmakers in the ruling Democratic Party (DP) signaled Friday they may more actively push to transfer wartime operational control (Opcon) to Korea from the United States, a long-debated shift that has repeatedly resurfaced under progressive administrations. Rep. Moon Jin-seog, the DP's senior deputy floor leader for parliamentary operations, told reporters Friday morning that the party could even consider revising the law to secure control in an emergency. Related Article Lee stresses 'national interest' as he presides over first National Security Council meeting U.S. calls to 'modernize' alliance with South Korea may put Seoul-Washington ties at a crossroads ""If it benefits the national interest, we can amend the law,"" he said when asked if the National Assembly was preparing such a bill. His comments came after the presidential office responded earlier to a media report claiming that Seoul had begun formal consultations with Washington on the Opcon transfer. Opcon, or operational control, refers to the authority to command military operations. Korea regained peacetime operational control in 1994, but wartime control has remained with the U.S.-led Combined Forces Command since 1978. Progressive civic groups with strong anti-American leanings have repeatedly pressed for ""full Opcon transfer"" whenever a DP administration takes power. During his campaign, President Lee Jae Myung also pledged to ""pursue the transfer of Opcon based on the Korea-U.S. alliance,"" listing it as one of his top ten campaign promises. Still, the office downplayed any suggestion of new talks, saying Friday morning, ""We will continue close consultations with the United States. The transfer of wartime operational control has long been a subject of discussion between Seoul and Washington and is not a new issue."" Still, the DP appeared to be adopting a more proactive stance. The Korean and U.S. flags stand side by side during a rotation brigade transfer of authority ceremony at Camp Casey in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi, on June 18. [YONHAP] DP Rep. Kim Woo-young, who has been tapped to join President Lee’s special delegation to the United States, also weighed in on the topic. Speaking on SBS Radio on Friday, Kim was asked whether discussions with Washington would cover not only defense cost-sharing but also Opcon transfer. ""Most issues should be brought to the surface,"" he said. ""From the perspective of mutual benefit, the level of adjustment is something that needs to proceed through negotiation."" ""As allies, there’s no reason Korea and the United States shouldn’t discuss these matters,"" he added. Kim, a key confidant of President Lee from his time as DP chair, previously served as Lee’s senior political affairs secretary. Some experts warn that the issue is too complex to be resolved hastily. Chung Ku-youn, a professor at Kangwon National University, cautioned that ""Opcon transfer is not the kind of bargaining chip that can be weighed on the same scale as tariff negotiations.""

Representing the opposition People Power Party, Kim had voiced concerns about the potential repercussions of dismantling the prosecution service. “You’re a lawyer known for defending the underprivileged — don’t let it sound like you’re opposing reform that curbs political prosecutors,” Park had said to Kim. To this, Kim replied, “You’ve lost sight in one eye, right? I have, too.” She went on to say, “I’ve lived with a disability all my life, but I rarely encountered other disabled people until I began public interest work as a lawyer.” Kim later elaborated on her intentions: “Park’s question seemed to suggest, ‘Why are you opposing prosecution reform if you claim to stand with the marginalized?’ I instinctively felt the need to clarify where I was coming from.” “Though I’ve had a disability since birth, I did well in school and was outspoken, so I rarely faced discrimination — until I became a public interest lawyer and met many disabled individuals who are treated as invisible by society,” Kim wrote. “I meant to say that systems must be designed with those people in mind.” “But due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to fully explain myself,” Kim wrote. “Instead, I ended up giving an awkward and inappropriate answer.” She concluded by saying, “To those hurt and angered by my careless words, I offer my sincerest apologies. Regardless of my intentions, nothing can excuse my actions yesterday.” Kim, who is visually impaired, has been practicing law since 2012 and is currently the head attorney at the Disability Rights Law Center, where she advocates for legal and systemic improvements to support people with disabilities.

[YONHAP] Theborn Korea, led by CEO and celebrity chef Paik Jong-won, announced on Thursday that it had shut down operations at its Baekseok plant in Yesan County, South Chungcheong, following allegations of violating the Farmland Act by using imported ingredients at a facility located in a protected agricultural zone. “To ensure safer product manufacturing and improved quality control, we have transferred the Baekseok plant’s production functions to our Yesan Plant and partner manufacturers,” Theborn Korea said. Related Article Theborn Korea brands see sales rebound after damage control discount campaign Paik Jong-won's YouTube channel uploads new videos amid TheBorn Korea controversy Chef Paik Jong-won to step away from TV to focus on scandal-hit TheBorn Korea It added that operations at the Baekseok facility ended in late June. “The employees of the Baekseok plant have been reassigned to our Yesan facility following individual consultations,” the company said. “Maintaining employment was the top priority.” Theborn Korea also noted that it is cooperating fully with an investigation by the South Chungcheong Provincial Police Agency regarding violations of the Farmland Act. The company added that it is in discussion with local governments and making efforts to comply with food-related laws and regulations. The Baekseok plant came under scrutiny for using imported ingredients in its soybean paste products, despite being located in a designated agricultural development area. Under the Farmland Act, facilities in these areas must produce food using domestically sourced agricultural and marine products. Paik and Theborn Korea has been embroiled in several scandals since early 2025 involving quality control, labeling, hygiene and leadership issues. Theborn Korea headquarters in Gangnam District, southern Seoul is seen on March 17. [NEWS1] Complaints arose that his processed meat product “Paik Ham” contained significantly less pork compared to competitors' Spam, yet was priced higher, triggering public outcry. Meanwhile, multiple products, including soy paste and beer, were found to contain foreign ingredients despite being marketed as Korean-made, meaning they violated country-of-origin labeling laws. These product-related issues were compounded by allegations of poor hygiene practices at festival booths, verbal abuse of staff and misuse of promotional fees. Additionally, earlier incidents such as a safety breach shown in a 2024 video resurfaced, adding to the public backlash. Consumer confidence and franchisee sales suffered as a result, with major brands like Paik’s Coffee, Hong Kong Banjum and Saemaul Restaurant reporting double-digit sales declines in April. In response, Paik publicly apologized, suspended his TV appearances to focus on crisis management and relaunched damage-control initiatives. “We sincerely apologize for using imported raw materials without properly understanding the laws,” the company previously stated.

719,10 power outages in a day: Heat wave strikes Seoul's poor in urban jjokbang villages,"Sprinklers spray water on a street near a jjokbang (tiny subdivided room) village in Jongno District, central Seoul [SHIN HYE-YEON] In Seoul’s jjokbang (tiny subdivided rooms) village in Donui-dong in Jongno District, central Seoul, where entire lives are squeezed into makeshift rooms barely large enough to stretch out, cooling fog devices hiss in the alleyways — but the mist feels like hot breath from the city’s asphalt. As apparent temperatures soar past 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), Korea’s most vulnerable residents are fighting a losing battle against the heat, armed with hand-held fans, cracked windows and shared electricity meters. Related Article From pain to rain: Heat wave expected to break on Sunday with return of downpours Number of heat-related patients surges at record pace amid extreme heat wave Livestock deaths skyrocket as record heat wave broils Korea At around 1 p.m. on Thursday, Seoul’s Donui-dong jjokbang village in Jongno District was blanketed in stifling heat. Mist from cooling fog devices sprayed out like smoke on various street corners, but the droplets felt more like hot steam. Residents sat in the shade, wearing sleeveless shirts and shorts. “The fans only blow hot air, so it’s useless,” said 76-year-old Lee Hong-geun, who has lived in the Donui-dong jjokbang village for 20 years. “The government installed an air conditioner in the hallway of the building I live in, but I can’t turn it on during the day because people come and go,” said another resident, 80-year-old Kim Yong-soo. ""I can only use it at night. Many elderly people are stuck in their small rooms because of health problems from the heat.” Similar scenes played out in another jjokbang village in Yeongdeungpo District, western Seoul. Residents sought shade to avoid the scorching sun. Although air fog systems were installed along the narrow alleys, the air remained humid. “There’s no air conditioner in my room, so at night, I shower, strip down to my underwear, and sleep with the door open,” said Song Ki-hong, 55, who has lived there since 2008. “I don’t even have a window, so opening the door is my only option.” At the village entrance, one resident lay on the shaded ground, taking a nap with this shirt pulled up.

In a 63-year-old resident surnamed Choi’s home, where they lived for 10 years, the indoor temperature was even higher than the 34 degrees Celsius outside. The sun beat down through the flimsy sandwich panels, turning the room into a greenhouse. After a fire in March destroyed his electricity meter and wiring, his newly bought air conditioner and refrigerator were rendered useless. “After the fire, it rained, and I hurried to protect my belongings, so I only managed to cover the roof with a single layer of vinyl,” Choi said. “If I could add a few more layers, the indoor temperature would drop by two or three degrees, but it would cost over 1 million won, so I haven’t tried.” Choi added that the drinks they left soaking in cold water from the village hall overnight had become lukewarm by morning.

[SHIN HYE-YEON] Although only four households had their power cut off completely, others were still not spared from the impact of the heat. Most of the houses in Honeybee Village are made of sandwich panels that trap heat, and residents are reluctant to use air conditioners freely due to high electricity costs. “People either stay at friends’ homes or cool off at Gyeongma Park Station on Subway Line 4,” said Jo Do-won, 63, head of the Honeybee Village Residents' Committee. “One power meter is shared among six or seven households, so the output is limited, and the progressive electricity tariff makes people hesitant to use air conditioning.” He added that the village suffered about 10 power outages in a single day. Around 700 people are currently living in the 450 or so households in Honeybee Village. A total of 1,228 heat-related illness cases and eight deaths were recorded between May 15 and Tuesday, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Experts stress that vulnerable populations need extra care during heat waves. A broken fuse box is seen outside a jjokbang (tiny subdivided room) in Honeybee Village in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi on July 10. [SHIN HYE-YEON] “Vinyl greenhouses and shantytowns heat up more than the outside, and without air conditioning, staying indoors for extended periods can lead to serious heat-related illnesses,” said Kang Jae-heon, a doctor of family medicine at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. “Elderly people, in particular, tend to feel less thirst or heat than they actually should and have diminished thermoregulation,” Kang said. “They should reduce time spent at home and use public shelters.” He suggested that efforts to improve housing requirements are also necessary in addition to heat wave countermeasures. “With extreme heat and cold lasting longer throughout the year, vulnerable groups are increasingly exposed to housing crises,” said Jegal Hyun-sook, a lecturer in social welfare at Hanshin University. “While creating shelters is important, it is essential to provide public housing at price levels they can realistically afford,” she said.

722,"Next year's minimum wage to rise to 10,320 won, first decision on pay by Lee gov't","This year's minimum wage is displayed on a poster in front of an employment support center in Mapo District, western Seoul on July 3. [YONHAP] Next year’s minimum wage will be set at 10,320 won ($7.50) per hour, the first minimum wage decision under the Lee Jae Myung administration. This also marks the first tripartite agreement between labor, management and public interest groups in 17 years. The Minimum Wage Commission finalized the 2026 minimum wage on Thursday at 10,320 won per hour, an increase of 290 won, or 2.9 percent, from this year’s rate of 10,030 won. Related Article Stalemate over minimum wage signals need for structural reform Protracted bus strike in Gwangju ends as labor, management reach wage, collective bargaining deal Labor unions call for 14.7% rise in minimum wage as gov't set to deliberate When calculated on a monthly basis, assuming a 40-hour workweek and 209 working hours per month, the minimum wage amounts to 2,156,880 won. Initially, labor representatives demanded a 14.7 percent increase to 11,500 won, while management called for a freeze at 10,030 won. With the two sides failing to narrow their differences, public interest commissioners proposed a “deliberation fast-track range” of 10,210 won, or a 1.8 percent increase, to 10,440 won, or a 4.1 percent increase. Although four worker commissioners affiliated with the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) walked out in protest of the proposed range, the remaining members — including nine public interest commissioners, nine employer representatives and five worker representatives from the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) — continued discussions and reached a consensus. This marks the seventh time the minimum wage has ever been set through a labor-management agreement, and the first since 2008.

[우지원 기자] The Labubu effect: Crowds continue at Korea's Pop Mart stores despite lack of iconic toy 라부부 없어도 여전한 인기… 한국 팝마트 매장 북새통 Korea JoongAng Daily 10면 기사 Tuesday, July 1, 2025 No Labubu, no problem. The most sought-after plush toy may have vanished from Pop Mart branches in Korea, but the stores are still swarming with people. In the middle of central Seoul's Myeong-dong neighborhood — known for the sweet scent of batter wafting from street stalls, flashy storefronts vying for attention and tourists dragging suitcases across lanes — one store stood out as the busiest. It was Pop Mart. sought-after: 수요가 많은, 인기 있는 vanish: 사라지다 swarm with: ~로 북적이다 waft: (냄새 등이) 퍼지다 vie for attention: 관심을 끌기 위해 경쟁하다 라부부가 없다고? 그래도 괜찮다. 가장 인기 있는 인형 ‘라부부’가 매장에서는 사라졌지만, 팝마트는 여전히 사람들로 북적인다. 서울 명동 중심가, 갓 구운 반죽 냄새가 퍼지는 길거리, 형형색색의 간판들, 여행 가방을 끄는 관광객들 사이에서 가장 붐비는 곳은 바로 팝마트였다. Inside the China-based collectible toy retailer’s brightly lit store on Friday, people stood shoulder-to-shoulder. Various languages could be heard from every corner, and shelves overflowed with colorful, palm-sized plushies — some adorably creepy — along with figures, key chains and mystery boxes. collectible toy: 수집용 장난감 stand shoulder-to-shoulder: 빽빽이 서 있다 overflow with: ~로 넘치다 adorably creepy: 귀엽지만 오싹한 mystery box: 어떤 제품이 들어 있는지 알 수 없는 랜덤 박스 지난 금요일(6월27일), 조명을 밝게 밝힌 중국 기반의 수집형 장난감 브랜드 팝마트 명동점 내부는 발 디딜 틈 없이 사람들이 가득했다. 작고 알록달록한 인형들로 가득한 선반과 피규어, 열쇠고리, 미스터리 박스까지 다양한 상품이 나열되어 있었다. 여러 나라 언어가 사방에서 들려왔다. Even without the blind box lineup of the wildly popular fluffy Labubu plushies, the store was packed with people, particularly international tourists. Blind boxes are mystery packages where shoppers don’t know which figure they’ll receive until they open it. blind box: 랜덤 박스 wildly popular: 폭발적인 인기를 끈 가장 인기 있던 ‘라부부’ 랜덤 박스가 없음에도 불구하고, 팝마트 매장은 여전히 사람이 많았고, 특히 해외에서 온 관광객들로 붐볐다. 랜덤 박스는 어떤 피규어가 들어 있을지 알 수 없는 랜덤형 패키지다. So, what’s driving the frenzy even after the store's most iconic character has disappeared from shelves? The answer: a broader selection of other toy lineups, limited global access to products, favorable exchange rates and an ever-expanding universe of collectible characters. drive the frenzy: 열풍을 이끌다 iconic character: 대표 캐릭터 favorable exchange rate: 유리한 환율 ever-expanding universe: 계속 확장되는 세계관 가장 상징적인 캐릭터가 사라진 후에도 팝마트의 계속된 인기는 왜일까? 그 이유는 더 다양한 제품군, 글로벌 시장에서 구하기 어려운 제품들이라는 점, 유리한 환율, 그리고 계속 확장되는 캐릭터의 세계관 덕분이다. On June 17, Pop Mart Korea announced it would suspend sales of Labubu toys, modeled after a sharp-toothed creature designed by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung for his “The Monsters” series in 2015 and produced by Pop Mart, over safety concerns. After celebrities like Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Blackpink’s Lisa and Rosé were seen with Labubus, the toys' fame skyrocketed. Fans began camping outside stores for release-day drops at branches in Myeong-dong and at Coex in southern Seoul, which eventually drew complaints from nearby businesses. modeled after: ~을 본떠 만든 skyrocket: 치솟다, 급상승하다 camp outside: 야외에서 밤샘 대기하다 6월 17일 팝마트 코리아는 안전성 문제로 홍콩 아티스트 카싱 렁이 디자인한 ‘더 몬스터즈’ 시리즈의 날카로운 이빨을 가진 생물체 ‘라부부’의 판매를 중단한다고 밝혔다. 리한나, 두아 리파, 블랙핑크의 리사와 로제가 라부부를 들고 있는 모습이 알려지며 이 인형은 인기가 폭발했고, 명동과 코엑스 매장에는 출시 때마다 팬들이 밤을 새우며 줄을 섰고, 이는 인근 상점들의 항의로 이어졌었다. “Labubus were sold on a first-come, first-served basis, so people camped outside. But it got too crowded, so the Chinese headquarters decided to stop sending them to Korea,” said an employee at the Myeong-dong branch. But the crowds never left. “The number of people coming in is just like before,” said another store worker. “Except now, we don’t see tents.” first-come, first-served: 선착순 get crowded: 붐비다 명동점 직원은 “라부부는 선착순 판매라 사람들이 밖에서 캠핑을 했다. 하지만 인파가 몰리며 매장 밖이 붐비자 본사에서는 더 이상 재고를 보내지 않기로 했다""고 말했다. 그럼에도 불구하고 사람들은 여전히 몰려들고 있다. “찾아오는 사람 수는 전과 다를 바 없어요. 이제는 텐트만 안 보일 뿐이죠.” 라고 다른 직원은 말했다. And this isn’t just a Korea-specific phenomenon. Due to long lines, crowd surges and scuffles, Pop Mart also halted in-store Labubu sales in the United Kingdom on May 22. Despite this, a video reposted by PopmartUK on Instagram on Sunday still showed long queues forming outside British branches. Korea-specific: 한국에만 국한된 crowd surge: 인파가 몰리는 현상 scuffle: 소동, 실랑이 queue: 줄 이 현상은 한국에만 국한되지 않는다. 줄을 서고 인파가 몰리며 실랑이까지 벌어지자, 팝마트는 5월 22일 영국에서도 라부부 오프라인 판매를 중단했다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 팝마트 영국 계정이 인스타그램에 일요일 업로드한 영상에는 여전히 길게 줄을 선 영국 매장 앞 풍경이 담겨 있었다. In other countries where Pop Mart stores continue to sell Labubu toys, the hype is even more intense. The launch of snack-themed Labubu dolls drew a queue of around 160 fans at Pop Mart’s Ion Orchard store in Singapore on Saturday, according to The Straits Times. hype: 열기, 과열된 인기 launch: 출시 queue: 줄을 서다 라부부 오프라인 판매가 계속되고 있는 다른 나라에서는 열기가 더욱 더 뜨겁다. 스트레이츠 타임스에 따르면, 스낵 테마의 라부부 인형 출시 당일인 토요일, 싱가포르 아이온 오차드점에는 약 160명의 팬들이 줄을 섰다고 한다.

724,Former President Yoon jailed again amid escalating insurrection probe (KOR),"Former President Yoon Suk Yeol, facing insurrection charges over the Dec. 3 martial law incident, boards a vehicle to move to the Seoul Detention Center after attending a pretrial detention hearing at the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on July 9. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] Former President Yoon Suk Yeol was taken back into custody in the early morning hours of Thursday, July 10, marking his second arrest since being indicted as the alleged ringleader of an attempted insurrection. He had been released four months ago following a court decision to cancel his initial detention order in March. Yoon personally appeared at a detention warrant hearing on Wednesday and argued in his final statement that the Dec. 3 martial law declaration was merely a warning, not an act that undermined democracy. However, Nam Se-jin, a senior judge at the Seoul Central District Court, disagreed and issued the arrest warrant, citing concerns over evidence tampering. Legal analysts point to the retraction of testimony by Kang Ui-gu, former presidential aide, and Kim Sung-hoon, a former deputy chief of presidential security, as a decisive factor. Their reversals raised suspicions of coercion or obstruction of justice, thereby reinforcing the court’s rationale for detaining Yoon. While the rearrest of a former president is a grave moment for any democracy, many view it as a necessary step toward restoring order after more than seven months of political instability sparked by the unconstitutional martial law attempt. Several military commanders involved in the crackdown remain in detention, prompting criticism that Yoon, as the ultimate authority behind the order, had been treated with undue leniency. Prosecutors have also brought additional charges beyond the main insurrection case. Yoon is accused of illegally using the presidential security service to block the execution of a court-issued arrest warrant, and of directing officers to “show their guns” to police. Investigators allege that Yoon undermined the decision-making authority of Cabinet ministers during the martial law declaration and destroyed official documents used to justify the decree. He is also suspected of ordering the presidential office to delete encrypted phone records and of instructing a foreign press spokesperson to misrepresent the emergency order as lawful. Related Article Yoon to not appear at insurrection court hearing after being taken into custody, legal team says 'Unbearably hot': Ex-President Yoon to endure summer heat in cell alone as he awaits trial Court issues warrant returning ex-President Yoon to custody over martial law bid Heated courtroom battle expected as Yoon appears for pretrial detention hearing Yoon has denied wrongdoing, maintaining that all actions were taken in accordance with protocol. His renewed detention is expected to accelerate the work of multiple special prosecutors, including those leading the insurrection investigation, the probe into his wife Kim Keon Hee, and the case involving the death of a Marine corporal. Still, prosecutors face a test of integrity. Investigations must not become exercises in showmanship or driven by pretrial detention figures. The special counsel’s mandate requires an impartial, evidence-based approach focused on uncovering the truth, not amplifying speculation. Yoon, for his part, should take a more responsible posture. Continued deflection or denial risks placing disproportionate legal burdens on subordinates. He must cooperate fully with the judicial process, setting aside political rhetoric and embracing accountability. 윤석열 전 대통령 재구속 사필귀정이다 직권남용·공무집행 방해 혐의…법원 “증거인멸 염려” 철저한 후속 수사로 진상 규명…먼지털기식은 피해야 윤석열 전 대통령이 어제(10일) 새벽 다시 구속수감됐다. 내란 우두머리 혐의로 구속됐다가 지난 3월 법원의 구속취소 결정으로 풀려난 지 4개월여 만이다. 윤 전 대통령은 그제(9일) 영장실질심사에 직접 나와 최후진술을 통해 “비상계엄은 경고용이었고 민주주의를 후퇴시킨 차원이 아니었다”고 항변했으나 법원은 받아들이지 않았다. 남세진 서울중앙지법 영장전담 부장판사는 “증거를 인멸할 염려가 있다”고 구속영장 발부 사유를 밝혔다. 법조계에선 윤 전 대통령의 측근으로 불린 강의구 전 대통령실 부속실장과 김성훈 전 경호처 차장이 초기 진술을 번복한 것이 영장 발부에 중대한 영향을 미쳤다고 보고 있다. 이는 윤 전 대통령 측의 회유나 압박 가능성, 나아가 증거인멸 우려와 연결되기 때문이다. 전직 대통령이 다시 구속된 것은 이유를 막론하고 참담한 일이 아닐 수 없다. 하지만 12·3 비상계엄 이후 7개월 넘게 이어진 국가 혼란을 생각하면 사필귀정(事必歸正)이라 할 수 있다. 특히 위헌적 계엄을 실행한 군 지휘관들이 구속 상태로 재판을 받고 있는데 최종 책임자인 윤 전 대통령이 석방돼 있다는 것은 형평성 차원에서도 문제가 있었다. 더구나 재판 중인 내란 우두머리 혐의와 별개로 추가된 혐의 하나하나가 국가의 법질서를 형해화한 중대 사안이다. 국가기관인 경호처를 사실상 사병화해 법원이 발부한 체포영장 집행을 저지하고, 경찰에 “총을 보여주라”고 지시했다는 내용은 충격적이기까지 하다. 특검팀은 윤 전 대통령이 계엄 선포 전 국무회의에서 국무위원의 심의권 행사를 침해했고, 허위 공문서인 사후 계엄선포문 작성·폐기에 관여했다고 봤다. 또 외신 대변인에게 비상계엄이 적법한 것처럼 홍보하게 하고, 경호처에 비화폰 내용을 삭제하라고 한 혐의도 적용했다. 그러나 윤 전 대통령 측은 영장실질심사에서도 “규정상의 조치였다” “사실이 아니다”라고 반박한 것으로 전해졌다. 윤 전 대통령이 구속수감되면서 내란 특검은 물론이고 김건희 특검과 순직 해병 특검의 수사도 보다 속도감 있게 진행될 것으로 예상된다. 다만 특검도 유의할 점이 있다. 피의자의 인신 구속이 성과라는 도식에서 탈피해야 한다. 확인되지 않은 내용을 흘리면서 여론몰이를 하거나 먼지털기식 수사를 통해 구속 대상자를 늘리는 방식이어선 안 될 것이다. 무엇보다 도입 취지에 맞게 독립적으로 엄정하게 수사해 진상을 철저히 밝혀야 한다. 윤 전 대통령 역시 “지시한 적 없다”는 식으로 대응할 일이 아니다. 본인이 책임을 미루면 다른 사람들이 과도한 수사와 처벌을 받을 수 있다. 객관적인 사실에 부합하지 않는 궤변과 변명을 멈추고 책임 있는 자세로 수사와 재판을 받아야 할 것이다.

In professional sports, signing bonuses have long been used to lure star athletes. These upfront payments, offered in addition to salaries, are designed to secure top talent and build loyalty. In baseball, Shohei Ohtani and Stephen Strasburg each received bonuses exceeding $100 million. In football, FC Barcelona’s signing bonus to Lionel Messi reportedly reached 115.2 million euros ($135 million). But this trend is no longer limited to the world of sports. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reportedly offered signing bonuses of $100 million or more, along with even higher annual salaries, to recruit engineers and researchers from OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to be personally reaching out to potential recruits as Meta makes an aggressive push into artificial intelligence. Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox speaks at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, in Menlo Park, California on April 29. [AP/YONHAP] The company’s stock performance appears to justify its bold investment. As of July 1, Meta shares had climbed 26.06 percent this year, the highest gain among the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants, surpassing Nvidia’s 17.65 percent rise. With such strong market confidence, Meta has room to spend heavily on talent acquisition. This hiring spree is already having a visible effect. A growing number of researchers have left OpenAI to join Meta, prompting OpenAI to overhaul its compensation structure in an effort to retain staff. Executives at OpenAI have openly acknowledged their sense of urgency, likening Meta’s poaching to a break-in.

726,North Seongsu: Trendy but not trending (yet),"Subjective Cafe is tucked in between factories in the northern part of Seongsu. [PARK SANG-MOON] [ABOUT TOWN]: North Seongsu Seoul is often viewed as a modern, trendy metropolis filled with high-rise buildings, bright billboards and zooming subways. But behind its stylish facade is a more down-to-earth, people's place that goes less noticed. Depending on the part of the city, busy-working locals find solace and joy in things such as sizzling pork belly in an intimate barbecue restaurant, soju shots under a tent, coffee on the roof of a decades-old building and walks along the city's hidden trails. Each dong, or neighborhood, has its own history and remnants of the times before its rapid development, making Seoul a checkerboard of cultures and atmospheres. In this series, the Korea JoongAng Daily looks at both the past and the present of Seoul's neighborhoods and recommends how to best spend a day there like a local: What to see, where to eat. Seongsu is a neighborhood that speaks for itself. A towering Dior flagship, a five-story Olive Young, not one, not two, but at least five Musinsa shops packed within a few blocks and the buttery aroma of freshly baked salt bread wafting through the streets. These are some signature characteristics of Seongsu-dong: a flashy, bustling district teeming with fashionistas and youthful energy. But this is only a depiction of the southern part of the neighborhood. The northern section, dubbed ""Buk Seongsu,” with buk meaning north in Korean, remains largely untouched by the rapid commercialization affecting its southern counterpart. The area, roughly north of the Seongsu Station overpass, has retained much of its industrial identity established in the 1960s. It boasts printing houses, machinery shops and car repairs still in full operation. And it is perhaps this slower, more grounded atmosphere that is increasingly drawing in locals, remote workers and trend-savvy tourists looking to avoid the usual hot spots. The Korea JoongAng Daily presents an itinerary that explores the understated half of Seoul’s trendiest neighborhood. But be warned: This side of town is slower, but not quieter. The maze of alleyways is constantly filled with the clatter of construction, brick-conveying forklifts and cement dust. Seongsu-dong is a mixture of factories and red-brick detached houses.

Back then only a collection of farmlands on what was considered the fringes of Seoul, Seongsu-dong had cheap land prices and an abundant work force nearby. The newcomers built factories as well as their homes, forming a unique mixture of factories and detached houses. The adjacent Han River and Jungnang Stream also made the neighborhood convenient for shipping logistics. It was significantly downsized after the IMF in 1997, but mid-sized blue-collar facilities such as car repairs and print shops are still standing. Whether due to spillover from the saturated southern part of Seongsu-dong or simply the innate charm of the northern area itself, cafes, diners and creative ateliers have been popping up in recent years. A signature grilled octopus dish at WIP Seongsu paired with Romanesco sauce and potatoes [JIN EUN-SOO] All-day diner WIP Seongsu A brunch place and a natural wine bar at the same time, this Brooklyn loft-style eatery is tucked away in an old alley just behind a line of car repair centers on the main road. One of the earliest pioneers to settle down in the neighborhood in 2020, its atmosphere encapsulates the essence of Buk Seongsu with exposed ceilings and concrete floors, but also exudes warmth due to ample sunlight beaming in through wide windows and a generous number of plants and flowers scattered throughout. The menu seems standard at first glance, with pastas and steaks as key offerings, but each dish is spiced up with a creative kick. The Iberico bone steak is plated with coriander salad and fish sauce for a balanced, refreshing taste and comes with a side of homemade apple and beet puree. The Salsiccia oil pasta is another uncommon menu item. The slightly pungent aroma unique to the Italian sausage is perfectly paired with a glass of chilled white wine. The abalone risotto made with sticky rice and barley has a pleasantly chewy texture, but what truly gives it character is a pinch of lemon zest. The signature grilled octopus dish with Romesco sauce is a must-try as well. Songjeong Embankment Road near Jungnang Stream serves as a shaded reprieve during summer. [JIN EUN-SOO] A walk by Jungnang Stream A 10-minute walk from WIP will bring you to a trail alongside Jungnang Stream called Songjeong Embankment Road, a go-to spot for Seongsu residents. The road is both a hidden gem for viewing cherry blossoms in spring and a leafy hideout from the sun in summer. Just half a step down from the embankment path lies a red clay trail great for walking on barefoot, a health practice trendy among Korea's elderly population. Be mindful of the trail exits because they are few and far in between. Miss one and your next opportunity to leave might be a couple hundred meters away. Inside the Subjective Cafe, which has exposed concrete ceilings and walls [PARK SANG-MOON] Sip coffee, work and relax Lining the Songjeong Embankment Road is a row of low-slung, single-unit factories specializing in metal and steel processing. Many operate with their shutters open, exposing passerby to stray sparks and the smell of burning steel. Tucked in between two such factories is the Subjective Cafe , part of a multipurpose space that hosts pop-ups, photo shoots and other events. The minimalist white interior, exposed concrete walls and high ceiling commonly found in warehouses give somewhat of a cold first impression, but the atmosphere is anything but. The staff is welcoming and the space is designed with remote workers in mind. Each table is equipped with power outlets, a rare sight in Korea except for in select franchises. Especially in busy neighborhoods like Seongsu where some cafes have a two-hour time limit, this gesture of generosity stands out. In addition to coffee, ade and tea, which are already up to standard, the Subjective Cafe also offers a selection of bottled beer and wine for those dropping by to chill. An iced Americano served at Bonzrr cafe [JIN EUN-SOO] Various other cafes in the area are also worth visiting. Maat Coffee Brewers serves non-coffee items such as a Jirisan mugwort latte alongside its signature Einspanner. Once a mom-and-pop supermarket, the remodeled venue stands out with its bright yellow exterior on an otherwise monotonous street. Peer Coffee , another star roastery with beginnings in Seongsu-dong, is famous for its specialty brews and pour-overs. Its popularity is no secret — other locations have already opened throughout Seoul and their coffee beans can be bought online. Another notable mention is Bonzrr, which acts as both a cafe and an exhibition venue. The industrial style interior and large selection of green plants scream Instagram, but the coffee is more than just social media-worthy: It tastes incredible. Domansa is a community space nestled in the northern part of Seongsu-dong. [PARK SANG-MOON] Inside Domansa which is styled as a sarangbang, where locals gather to mingle and read books [PARK SANG-MOON] Vintage furniture, clothes and community Exploring Buk Seongsu is an odd experience. While the area is mostly redbrick detached homes, you might stumble upon a massive construction site with the turn of a corner, then find, only a block away, a quiet alleyway lined with old concrete buildings housing both laundromats and hipster cafes. In one of these quiet alleys sits a unique space called Domansa , where the door is often left open with no one inside. A modern red neon sign hangs on a weathered concrete wall, and beneath it are pyeongsang (a traditional Korean wooden platform) and books related to urban life. This unusual type of space is currently used as a communal cultural space where people can freely come in to relax, read and mingle. It also hosts various exhibitions, pop-ups and events on occasion. The second floor of the two-story building used to house a Chinese restaurant and a shoe factory, now both closed. Domansa offers factory and neighborhood tours, the schedules of which can be found on its Instagram. Markt Fahrt is a vintage furniture shop selling leather sofas and armchairs mostly sourced from Europe. [JIN EUN-SOO] Nearby, at vintage furniture shop Markt Fahrt , a curated selection of leather sofas and armchairs from Europe is on display. Each piece is unique in design and texture. Here, you can find vintage Hermes dishware or wooden cabinets that appear to have arrived directly from Paris's Vanve flea market. Even if you aren't on the market for new furniture, you can still have a visually delightful experience. Visits are reservation only, by Naver or phone call. A few blocks away, you'll find a perfume atelier called Hippocampu s in the basement of yet another red brick building. It's easy to miss, marked only by a modest ""H"" sign on the exterior. Under the guidance of the atelier's director, visitors can explore and create scents to one's liking among the dark wooden tables of the cozy, dimly lit venue. A dozen or so scents created by the director, going by names like ""Me Time"" and ""Nova,” are also on display and available for purchase. Soinsu Seoul is a gopchang (grilled intestine) place near Ttukseom Station, Line No. 2. [JIN EUN-SOO] Seoul's soul food Nobody would imagine such a packed full-day itinerary for this part of town, but there is surprisingly room for one more stop. Walk for 10 minutes following the overpass toward Ttukseom Station and you'll arrive at Soinsu Seoul , a decent gopchang (grilled intestine) restaurant. Tucked underneath the overpass, this diner gently rattles whenever a train passes overhead. Assorted grilled gopchang, their signature menu, is a must. It is served pre-grilled with seasoned chives and potatoes. The homemade soy sauce with chopped onions and green peppers adds a special touch. A barbecue restaurant like this always serves up some mouthwatering sides. The chili beef intestine soup, which includes tripe and vegetables, is highly recommended as comfort food. This place is already well known among locals as well as tourists. On a Friday evening at 7 p.m., there was a good mix of office workers in for a hoesik (after-work dinner) as well as couples and tourists all down for some good gopchang.

728,AI talent war intensifies as signing bonuses soar,"Cho Won-kyeong The author is a professor at UNIST and the head of the Global Industry-University Cooperation Center. In professional sports, signing bonuses have long been used to lure star athletes. These upfront payments, offered in addition to salaries, are designed to secure top talent and build loyalty. In baseball, Shohei Ohtani and Stephen Strasburg each received bonuses exceeding $100 million. In football, FC Barcelona’s signing bonus to Lionel Messi reportedly reached 115.2 million euros ($135 million). But this trend is no longer limited to the world of sports. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reportedly offered signing bonuses of $100 million or more, along with even higher annual salaries, to recruit engineers and researchers from OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to be personally reaching out to potential recruits as Meta makes an aggressive push into artificial intelligence. Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox speaks at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, in Menlo Park, California on April 29. [AP/YONHAP] The company’s stock performance appears to justify its bold investment. As of July 1, Meta shares had climbed 26.06 percent this year, the highest gain among the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants, surpassing Nvidia’s 17.65 percent rise. With such strong market confidence, Meta has room to spend heavily on talent acquisition. This hiring spree is already having a visible effect. A growing number of researchers have left OpenAI to join Meta, prompting OpenAI to overhaul its compensation structure in an effort to retain staff. Executives at OpenAI have openly acknowledged their sense of urgency, likening Meta’s poaching to a break-in. Managers are reportedly engaging in daily discussions with employees who have received outside offers in hopes of persuading them to stay.

729,Allegations of academic plagiarism expose political double standards,"Joo Jung-wan The author is an editorial writer at the JoongAng Ilbo. As Education Minister nominee Lee Jin-sook faces allegations of academic plagiarism, critics are calling out what they see as a troubling pattern of selective outrage within Korea’s political landscape. Imagine if these same allegations were leveled not at Lee, but at Kim Keon Hee, the wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. The response from the Democratic Party would likely be swift and unrelenting. In the past, Democratic lawmakers have fiercely attacked even minor suspicions surrounding figures tied to conservative politics. Education Minister nominee Lee Jin-soo speaks to reporters as she arrives at the Korea Institute of Educational Facility Safety in western Seoul on June 30. [YONHAP] Yet in Lee’s case, the dominant tone among the ruling Democratic Party, which nominated her, has been strikingly quiet. While internal discussions may be ongoing, little has been voiced publicly — an omission that many observers find disappointing. The ruling party's opponents, particularly the People Power Party (PPP), have also shown inconsistency. Many who defended Kim Keon Hee during similar controversies are now demanding rigorous scrutiny of Lee’s academic record. But plagiarism is not a partisan issue — it is, fundamentally, an ethical one. Misrepresenting someone else's research as one’s own is an act of intellectual theft, and it is particularly shameful when committed by scholars and educators. In Kim Keon Hee’s case, Sookmyung Women’s University recently concluded that her master’s thesis plagiarized significant portions of Rosemary Lambert’s ""20th Century Art."" As a result, her degree was revoked. The university’s decision came more than three and a half years after plagiarism allegations first emerged in December 2021, ahead of the 20th presidential election. Many question why the process took so long, especially given the evident similarities between Kim’s thesis and the source material. The university delayed launching an official review, and its final judgment came only after a change in administration returned the Democratic Party to power. This timeline has fueled speculation about political pressure, leaving some Sookmyung alumnae wondering publicly whether their university failed to uphold academic integrity. Lee’s case warrants the same standards. A comparison between her thesis and that of one of her students suggests significant overlap — enough to raise questions of outright copying. If Lee used her student’s work without proper attribution, the issue should be addressed promptly and transparently. If not, she must provide a credible explanation. Related Article Is Education Minister nominee Lee Jin-sook fit for the role? Cabinet nominees cite hearings, avoid explaining controversies Confirmation hearing for prime minister nominee falls short of 'fair' pledge Slew of Cabinet nominations consolidate DP authority, tap outside experts The National Assembly’s Education Committee is scheduled to hold Lee’s confirmation hearing on July 16. Although the Democratic Party holds a majority in the legislature, the hearing must not become a mere formality. Lawmakers must thoroughly evaluate Lee’s qualifications and integrity. The public expects accountability, not partisan loyalty. A similar controversy surrounds Chung Eun-kyung, the nominee for Minister of Health and Welfare. Chung’s husband is suspected of violating the Farmland Act. Article 121 of the Constitution states that farmland must be owned and cultivated by those who personally farm it. The law allows limited exceptions, but it remains unclear whether Chung’s husband qualifies. Chung’s husband works as a physician in Incheon, raising doubts about whether he realistically could have commuted to and farmed land in Pyeongchang, Gangwon. If he did farm the land himself, documentation should be made available to confirm it. Compounding the controversy is the fact that someone else reportedly received direct government subsidies — so-called “basic agricultural payments” — for farming that land. If Chung’s husband was the one farming it, that inconsistency must be explained. If someone else improperly claimed the subsidy, they must be held accountable under the law. Chung Eun-kyung, nominee for Minister of Health and Welfare, arrives at her confirmation hearing preparation office in Namdaemun-ro, Jung District, Seoul, on June 30. [YONHAP] This episode recalls the 2021 case of former PPP lawmaker Yoon Hee-sook, whose father was accused of violating the same law. At the time, Democratic lawmakers insisted that even if Yoon had no direct involvement, she still benefited and should be held responsible. Yoon eventually resigned from her post. The same standard should apply to Chung. Replacing “father” with “husband” is all that is needed to maintain consistency. Anything less would suggest that political loyalty trumps ethics. A double standard in such matters would only reinforce public cynicism toward Korea’s political class.

730,China’s quiet push in the Yellow Sea poses serious threat to Korean sovereignty,"Kim Jung-ha The author is an editorial writer at the JoongAng Ilbo. The first territorial threat to Korea since its founding came 75 years ago from the North. Today, a second encroachment is unfolding — this time from the West. Unlike the direct and violent nature of the Korean War, China’s so-called “Yellow Sea project” is progressing slowly and quietly, making it harder for the public to sense its gravity. Yet the consequences could be severe if China succeeds in turning the Yellow Sea into its own inland sea. An “inland sea” is a body of water enclosed by land and connected to the open sea only by a narrow passage. In contrast to territorial waters, where foreign vessels retain the right of innocent passage, inland seas allow the coastal state full control, much like land territory. If China effectively declares the Yellow Sea as such, it would mark a substantial expansion of its sovereignty toward the Korean Peninsula, with clear implications for Korea’s national security. A closer look at China’s claimed “marine observation buoys” installed in and around the Provisional Measures Zone in the West Sea. Clockwise from top left: “Carbon Dioxide Flow Monitoring Buoy”, “China Marine Surveillance Buoy QF219” , “China Marine Monitoring Buoy QF209” and “China Marine Surveillance Buoy QF111.″ [REPUBLIC OF KOREA NAVY] China’s claims are inconsistent with international law. In 2000, Korea and China signed a fisheries agreement that designated overlapping exclusive economic zones (EEZ) in the Yellow Sea as a Provisional Measures Zone (PMZ), managed jointly by both countries. Within the PMZ, fishing is allowed, but the construction of facilities and resource development is prohibited. However, since 2018, China has unilaterally installed several large steel-frame structures in the zone, claiming they are for aquaculture. Although nominally fishing-related, these platforms can easily be repurposed for military use. Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged formal protests, but China has not responded. In February, when Korea’s research vessel Onnuri approached the area to conduct an investigation, China deployed two large vessels and three inflatable boats to physically block the operation. Reports indicate that one of the Chinese personnel even threatened Korean researchers with a weapon. These installations appear designed to serve as a pretext for China to declare sovereignty over the Yellow Sea in the future — mirroring its strategy in the South China Sea. There, China has built artificial islands and asserted expansive claims, including a so-called “nine-dash line” that reaches over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from its mainland, encroaching on the waters near Indonesia. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled the claim invalid. China has ignored the ruling ever since. International law has proven ineffective in the face of power politics. Related Article China’s rising activity in the West Sea raises regional security concerns Chinese ship runs aground off Philippines-occupied island in the disputed South China Sea China's steel towers in PMZ raise 'South China Sea 2.0' question: Ex-top U.S. envoy China’s Yellow Sea strategy is part of a long-term plan to protect the politically and economically strategic corridor stretching from the Bohai Gulf to Beijing. This is not a temporary campaign that can be expected to fade with time or a change in leadership. Even if the Xi Jinping administration ends, future Chinese governments are likely to continue pursuing the same objective. Japan’s claim over Dokdo, by contrast, is not an immediate threat. As long as the Korea-U.S.-Japan security partnership remains intact, Korea’s sovereignty over Dokdo is secure. But China’s actions in the West Sea are already altering the status quo. The threat is not hypothetical — it is real and growing. In many respects, it is far more serious than the Dokdo dispute. Korea must respond with a long-term, consistent strategy that transcends administrations. If China refuses to dismantle its structures, Korea should consider installing similar facilities in response. Vietnam’s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea provides a useful precedent. Korea should also work closely with the United States, Japan and other members of the international community to mount a coordinated response. Strengthening naval power is equally essential. The 13.2 trillion won ($9.6 biillion) the government plans to distribute as consumer vouchers in its latest supplementary budget could instead fund the construction of 10 King Jeongjo-class Aegis destroyers.

[REUTERS/YONHAP] Above all, Korea needs strong national resolve to defend its maritime sovereignty. Yet concern remains. When the National Assembly passed a resolution on July 3 condemning China’s installation of structures in the Yellow Sea, seven lawmakers from the broader ruling coalition abstained. They included Democratic Party lawmakers Kim Young-bae, Lee Ki-heon and Hong Ki-won; New Reform Party member Shin Jang-sik; and Progressive Party lawmakers Son Sol, Jeon Jong-deok and Yoon Jong-oh. For sitting members of the legislature to hesitate on such a critical issue raises questions about their commitment to national sovereignty.

731,Shifting U.S. security priorities put Korea-U.S. alliance under strain,"Choi Yoon-hee The author is president of the Sea  Power League of the Republic of Korea and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff The Korea-U.S. combined defense system is the foundation of the Republic of Korea’s national security, designed to deter and respond to threats from North Korea. It includes the United Nations Command, the Combined Forces Command, wartime operational control (Opcon), South Korean forces, and United States Forces Korea (USFK). Yet growing concerns have emerged regarding the future of this alliance, especially in the wake of the Donald Trump administration’s foreign policy shift. A report released Thursday by former U.S. defense officials, including Dan Caldwell, recommended reducing U.S. ground combat troops in Korea and scaling back U.S. air squadrons — cutting the total U.S. troop presence from 28,500 to just 10,000. Earlier, Elbridge Colby, former deputy assistant secretary of defense, stated that “the United States has no reason to get involved in a major conflict with North Korea.” These views reflect a broader shift in Washington, where discussions about redefining USFK’s role, accelerating Opcon transfer and increasing Seoul’s financial burden are gaining traction. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivers his speech during the 22nd Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 31. [AP/YONHAP] Some reports suggest that the UN Command could relocate from Seoul to Japan with a U.S. commander stationed in Japan assuming leadership. Such moves would mark a significant shift in the security posture on the Korean Peninsula. These developments echo the former Acheson Line, which excluded Korea from the U.S. defense perimeter — a mistake that led to a major miscalculation by the North. There are two key ways to interpret recent U.S. moves. First, the United States is struggling to counter China’s growing influence while maintaining global commitments. China’s maritime expansion threatens U.S. naval dominance, a core pillar of American strategic interests. Second, Washington may be signaling its discomfort with Seoul’s inconsistent policies toward the U.S. and China, which shift with each new Korean administration. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s statement at the Shangri-La Dialogue on May 31 — “There is no such thing as relying on the U.S. for security and China for the economy” — was a clear rebuke of Korea’s perceived policy of “security with the U.S., economy with China.” U.S. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan (2nd from R, front row) visits the shipyard of Hanwha Ocean Co. in the southeastern industrial city of Geoje on April 30. [YONHAP] Regardless of administration changes, countering China remains Washington’s top strategic priority. However, the United States is no longer as dominant as it once was. China continues to expand its maritime presence, having constructed artificial islands in the South China Sea and now installing permanent structures in the Yellow Sea. China’s naval strategy includes establishing ports in 12 countries, which could soon double as military bases. In contrast, the U.S. shipbuilding industry has declined since the Ronald Reagan administration ended subsidies for the sector following the Cold War. Today, the United States has fewer than five functioning shipyards while China’s shipbuilding capacity is 230 times greater. As of the early 2020s, China possessed about 7,000 merchant vessels capable of transporting military goods, compared to just 82 in the United States. If conflict were to erupt in the Taiwan Strait under these conditions, the consequences could be disastrous. When I accompanied U.S. Navy Secretary John Phelan on a visit to HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in May, I saw firsthand how concerned U.S. officials were about this imbalance. Washington’s new SHIPS Act seeks to rebuild maritime strength, but restoring the industry will take decades. In the meantime, the United States is turning to Korean shipbuilding — a rare strategic opportunity that Korea should leverage in security and trade negotiations. At the same time, Korea must anticipate U.S. pressure to shoulder more of its defense burden. This includes more than just increased contributions to USFK. On June 28, U.S. Forces Japan Commander Stephen Jost wrote in the Japanese press that U.S. command authority in the region would gradually expand. He also mentioned the possibility of relocating the Combined Forces Command to Japan. While UN Security Council Resolution 84 of 1950 does not specify the command’s location, such a move would shift the UN Command’s focus from Korean Peninsula deterrence to broader regional management.

Still, U.S. decisions are likely to be made unilaterally, regardless of Korea’s views. It would not be the first time. In 1969, President Richard Nixon declared in the Guam Doctrine that Asian nations should defend themselves, leading to partial troop withdrawals. In 2015, while helping draft Korea-U.S. combined operational plans, I realized how difficult it was to reflect Korea’s strategic preferences in key planning documents. That frustration still resonates. Korea may have to accept a redefined role for USFK, perhaps even accelerated Opcon transfer. This issue was a major focus during my tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Roh Moo-hyun administration initially aimed for a time-based transfer in 2012, but in 2014, the two allies agreed to shift to a condition-based approach. The three key conditions were: adequate military capabilities for combined defense, comprehensive allied capability to counter North Korean nuclear threats and a stable regional security environment. None of these conditions are easily met. Retired U.S. Lt. Gen. John Daniel Caine, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifies before a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on April 1. [REUTERS/YONHAP] In April, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine told a congressional hearing that Korea still had not met these standards, implying that Seoul’s defense capabilities remain insufficient. Still, Korea cannot afford to rely on the United States alone. As threats mount, Seoul must prepare for contingencies where U.S. support may be limited. The time has come to ready our own defenses — if not with teeth, then with gums.

732,A Ministry for the Korean Peninsula is long overdue,"Park Myung-lim The author is a political professor of Yonsei University. Debate regarding government reorganization is gaining momentum in Korea, driven in part by the presidential impeachment. Reconstructing the government structure at this juncture could offer a chance to redirect the nation’s priorities. While the most urgent tasks remain constitutional reform for power redistribution and the creation of a population ministry to address demographic decline, I would like to highlight another reform: transforming the Ministry of Unification into a ministry for the Korean Peninsula. Given today’s geopolitical realities, reunification is not only unlikely but largely symbolic. That does not mean the idea must be abandoned. Rather, the problem is that the Ministry of Unification, as it currently exists, has limited capacity to act. It is a stand-alone agency without the authority to engage meaningfully with the wide range of issues that define inter-Korean relations. Flags flutter in the western section of the demilitarized zone as seen from the border in Paju, Gyeonggi, on Feb. 18. The South Korean flag is visible in Daeseong-dong on the southern side while the North Korean flag flies in Kijong-dong village to the north. On the same day, North Korea issued a statement condemning a joint declaration by South Korea, the United States and Japan that reaffirmed the goal of the “complete denuclearization of North Korea.” [YONHAP] This limitation was evident during the Lee Myung-bak administration, when the transition team even considered abolishing the ministry entirely, significantly cutting its personnel and scope. Instead of debating abolition versus retention, I previously proposed a third path — restructuring it into the ministry for the Korean Peninsula. That proposal is more relevant now than ever. Adopting a Korean Peninsula-centered policy framework allows for broader engagement. It encompasses not only the reunification or North Korea policy, but a comprehensive approach to all peninsula-related issues: peace, denuclearization, human rights, reconciliation, economic cooperation, health care, environmental sustainability and more. It bridges conservative and progressive agendas and moves beyond the ideological confines of reunification rhetoric. Importantly, changing the ministry’s name would not violate the constitutional principle of peaceful unification. Ministry names are administrative, not constitutional matters. In fact, the Park Chung Hee government established the National Unification Board — a predecessor to the current ministry — in 1969, when the Constitution had no articles on reunification. The unification clauses were added later, during the Yushin Constitution era. Ironically, these additions occurred during the simultaneous consolidation of authoritarian regimes in both Koreas, raising questions about the political motivations behind the constitutional revisions. Related Article Gov't mulls renaming Unification Ministry amid changing realities on the Korean Peninsula Is 'unification' becoming a taboo word in Korea? Unification Ministry suspends head of defector support foundation over sexual harassment allegations Kim Jong-un's 'hostile states' theory still a work in progress, former North Korean envoy-turned-defector says Creating a “ministry of peace on the peninsula” may sound appealing, but it risks reinforcing a false dichotomy: that progressives pursue peace while conservatives pursue reunification. Such framing would provoke new ideological battles, especially if future conservative administrations attempt to revert to the Ministry of Unification. Similarly, a “ministry of inter-Korean affairs” would be problematic, as the terms “South” and “North” do not align with Korea’s legal and constitutional framework. Public sentiment must also be considered. Recent surveys show that many Koreans — especially younger generations — prefer peaceful coexistence over immediate reunification. They envision a future of independent coexistence, where managing inter-Korean relations becomes one facet of a broader Korean Peninsula policy. This shift in public opinion demands that inter-Korean issues be seen as a subset of Korea’s national interests, not its overriding purpose. We must aim for peaceful coexistence, not forced unity. In doing so, we lay the foundation for eventual reunification led by future generations. Maintaining the territorial and unification clauses in the Constitution remains essential to preserve that long-term vision. Jeong Dong-yeong, nominee for minister of unification, answers questions from reporters as he arrives at his confirmation hearing preparation office at the Inter-Korean Relations Management Office in Jongno District, central Seoul, on June 24. [YONHAP] Germany offers a valuable precedent. In 1969, under Chancellor Willy Brandt, the Ministry for All-Germany Affairs was renamed the Ministry for Intra-German Affairs. By abandoning official reunification rhetoric and focusing on coexistence, the Brandt government engaged directly with the Soviet Union, Poland and the four Allied powers and eventually reached agreements with East Germany. This diplomatic pivot helped establish the framework for peaceful coexistence and laid the groundwork for eventual reunification. Korea now needs a similarly layered strategy. A Ministry for the Korean Peninsula would allow for policy coherence, institutional flexibility and a more realistic approach to managing inter-Korean relations. In times of growing uncertainty, this may be the wisest course forward.

733,Former President Yoon jailed again amid escalating insurrection probe,"Former President Yoon Suk Yeol, facing insurrection charges over the Dec. 3 martial law incident, boards a vehicle to move to the Seoul Detention Center after attending a pretrial detention hearing at the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on July 9. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] Former President Yoon Suk Yeol was taken back into custody in the early morning hours of Thursday, July 10, marking his second arrest since being indicted as the alleged ringleader of an attempted insurrection. He had been released four months ago following a court decision to cancel his initial detention order in March. Yoon personally appeared at a detention warrant hearing on Wednesday and argued in his final statement that the Dec. 3 martial law declaration was merely a warning, not an act that undermined democracy. However, Nam Se-jin, a senior judge at the Seoul Central District Court, disagreed and issued the arrest warrant, citing concerns over evidence tampering. Legal analysts point to the retraction of testimony by Kang Ui-gu, former presidential aide, and Kim Sung-hoon, a former deputy chief of presidential security, as a decisive factor. Their reversals raised suspicions of coercion or obstruction of justice, thereby reinforcing the court’s rationale for detaining Yoon. While the rearrest of a former president is a grave moment for any democracy, many view it as a necessary step toward restoring order after more than seven months of political instability sparked by the unconstitutional martial law attempt. Several military commanders involved in the crackdown remain in detention, prompting criticism that Yoon, as the ultimate authority behind the order, had been treated with undue leniency. Prosecutors have also brought additional charges beyond the main insurrection case. Yoon is accused of illegally using the presidential security service to block the execution of a court-issued arrest warrant, and of directing officers to “show their guns” to police. Investigators allege that Yoon undermined the decision-making authority of Cabinet ministers during the martial law declaration and destroyed official documents used to justify the decree. He is also suspected of ordering the presidential office to delete encrypted phone records and of instructing a foreign press spokesperson to misrepresent the emergency order as lawful.

His renewed detention is expected to accelerate the work of multiple special prosecutors, including those leading the insurrection investigation, the probe into his wife Kim Keon Hee, and the case involving the death of a Marine corporal. Still, prosecutors face a test of integrity. Investigations must not become exercises in showmanship or driven by pretrial detention figures. The special counsel’s mandate requires an impartial, evidence-based approach focused on uncovering the truth, not amplifying speculation. Yoon, for his part, should take a more responsible posture. Continued deflection or denial risks placing disproportionate legal burdens on subordinates. He must cooperate fully with the judicial process, setting aside political rhetoric and embracing accountability.

734,Summit date elusive amid U.S. pressure on troop costs and tariffs,"National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac gives a press briefing on the outcome of his trip to the United States at the Yongsan presidential office in central Seoul on July 9. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac returned from a three-day trip to Washington this week and confirmed that a date has yet to be set for a summit between President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump. The delay, following an earlier missed opportunity at the Group of 7 summit in Canada, reflects increasing complications in the Korea-U.S. alliance. The absence of a summit date comes as Washington sends a series of signals that are raising concerns in Seoul. In a cabinet meeting on July 8, Trump criticized U.S. allies, including Korea, for paying what he called “very little” for defense. “I believe Korea should be paying $10 billion a year,” he said, referencing the cost of maintaining U.S. forces on the peninsula. The comment came just a day after Trump sent a letter to President Lee announcing plans to impose a 25 percent reciprocal tariff on Korean exports beginning August 1. The move, paired with defense cost-sharing demands, has intensified pressure on Seoul. The Trump administration is also pressing NATO allies to commit 5 percent of their GDP to defense spending, a benchmark now being quietly extended to Asian allies like Korea and Japan. Korea currently spends about 2.3 percent of its GDP on defense, and any sharp increase would present significant fiscal challenges.

The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Pentagon was reviewing plans to relocate roughly 4,500 U.S. troops from Korea to other bases in the Indo-Pacific, such as Guam. More recently, a U.S. think tank report suggested reducing the current 28,500-strong U.S. Forces Korea to around 10,000. Although the Pentagon has not confirmed any such plan, concerns persist that similar proposals could be included in the forthcoming National Defense Strategy, expected in August. Taken together, these developments suggest the Trump administration may soon present Seoul with a formal list of alliance demands. Even before such a move, the Korean government must carefully analyze Washington’s intent and prepare multiple response scenarios. Given the alliance’s complexity, outright rejection of U.S. requests may not be an option. A pragmatic and flexible approach will be needed.

735,"Yoon assigned inmate No. 3617, held in 6-meter cell at Seoul Detention Center","Former President Yoon Suk Yeol leaves the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul after the pretrial detention hearing on July 9. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] Former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was taken into custody Thursday, has been moved into a solitary cell measuring just over 6.6 square meters (approximately 71 square feet) in a general ward at the Seoul Detention Center. Yoon has been assigned inmate No. 3617. Yoon entered the general housing unit following a meeting with his defense counsel and dinner, according to legal sources. He had previously been held in a temporary holding room for detainees awaiting admission following his pretrial detention hearing.

He then changed into a khaki-colored uniform designated for detainees awaiting trial and had a mug shot taken, sources said. Yoon is being held in a solitary cell previously used by a single inmate. Due to severe overcrowding, authorities were unable to place him in the larger room typically used for former presidents and assigned him to a smaller cell instead. When former President Park Geun-hye was detained in March 2017, she was held in a converted room originally designed for six to seven general inmates. That cell measured about 10.08 square meters including the bathroom. Former President Lee Myung-bak, detained in March 2018, was placed in a solitary cell at the Seoul Eastern Detention Center measuring 13.07 square meters including the bathroom. Unlike the temporary holding rooms, the general ward lacks air conditioning. Only electric fans are provided, which shut off automatically for 10 minutes every 50 minutes as a fire safety measure. Fan settings can be adjusted from levels 1 to 4. Yoon’s cell is reportedly equipped with a cabinet, a TV, a table that also serves as a dining tray, dishes and a toilet — but no sink. He sleeps on the floor using bedding provided by the facility. There is no bed, though the floor is heated using electric panels. He will shower in a communal facility, scheduled so that inmates do not overlap. Yoon’s lunch on his first full day in detention included doenjang jjigae (soybean paste stew), steamed egg, cucumber and onion salad and napa cabbage kimchi. Dinner consisted of kongnamul guk (bean sprout soup), gochujang (spicy chili sauce) bulgogi, green chili peppers with ssamjang (sauce) and kimchi.

On Monday, Trump announced a sweeping 25 percent tariff on all goods imported from Korea set to take effect on Aug. 1 through a letter addressed to President Lee, citing what he described as enduring trade imbalances between the two countries.

He now wears prison attire bearing his inmate number and no longer receives protection from the PSS because he has formally been transferred to the corrections authority. He received the same meals as other inmates, to the JoongAng Ilbo reported. Accelerated probe into treason charges With Yoon back in custody, the special counsel team has expedited investigations into other allegations, including foreign aggression. “Investigations during detention are limited to the charges in the warrant, but with the suspect’s consent, we can expand to other matters,” said Park. Former President Yoon Suk Yeol enters the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on July 9 for his pretrial detention hearing. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] Yoon was not questioned on the day of his detention but is scheduled to be summoned for questioning Friday. “While we’ll consider his status as a former president to the extent of public perception, he will otherwise be treated like any other suspect,"" said Park. The counsel recently detained several former top military officials, including former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, former Defense Counterintelligence Commander Yeo In-hyung and former commanders of the Defense Intelligence Command Moon Sang-ho and Noh Sang-won, before the expiration of their initial detention periods. The arrests are part of an ongoing investigation into claims that the military provoked North Korea to justify martial law — such as by sending drones over Pyongyang or planning to strike trash balloon launch sites. Now that the special counsel has secured custody of the top commander-in-chief at the time, Yoon, has sped up its broader investigation. “With Yoon now detained, we plan to focus on the foreign exchange violation charges,” said an official on the team. Some speculate that a search and seizure of the Drone Operations Command will take place soon. Former President Yoon Suk Yeol enters the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on July 9 for his pretrial detention hearing. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] The team also plans to to step up its probe into Han, who was named a co-conspirator. Investigators are also expected to summon key aides to the former president, all of whom were reportedly present at a secret meeting on Dec. 4, the day martial law was lifted. The investigation will also include claims that the conservative People Power Party (PPP) obstructed a National Assembly vote to repeal martial law. The allegation is that Yoon contacted then-floor leader Choo Kyung-ho to prevent the resolution from passing. The special counsel believes direct questioning of Choo and others to be inevitable. Legal challenge to detention likely Legal experts say Yoon may appeal as he did when arrested by the police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials in January. Korea permits convicts to request a review of the legality and necessity of their arrest. “The legal team is discussing whether to file for a detention review, but no decision has been made yet,” said Yoon’s lawyer.

741,Central bank hits pause on interest rate cuts in white hot housing market,"Bank of Korea (BOK) Gov. Rhee Chang-yong speaks during a press briefing at the BOK headquarters in Jung District, central Seoul, on July 10. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] The Bank of Korea (BOK) decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle, wary that a premature move could further fuel soaring home prices in Seoul. At its monetary policy meeting on Thursday, the BOK’s monetary policy board unanimously voted to keep the base interest rate steady at 2.5 percent. This marks a temporary hold as the board evaluates the impact of recent lending curbs introduced on June 27 to cool the overheated housing market before determining the timing and scale of future cuts. Related Article BOK keeps key interest rate unchanged amid concerns over household debt U.S. Fed leaves key interest rate unchanged, still projects two cuts this year BOK cuts interest rate to 2.5% as economic growth slows What held back a rate cut was the unrelenting rise in Seoul's housing prices. “The pace of price increases in the capital area is faster than in August last year,” said BOK Gov. Rhee Chang-yong at a press briefing held on Thursday in central Seoul. “The level of concern now is even higher.” The central bank also refrained from a rate cut in August last year, citing housing market overheating risks despite expectations of policy easing. Apartment prices in Seoul rose by 0.43 percent in the fourth week of June week-on-week, the biggest weekly jump since September 2018, according to the Korea Real Estate Board. As expectations of further price increases mount, low interest rates could further boost demand, particularly among those willing to stretch their borrowing capacity to buy property. The BOK predicts that the increase in housing transactions before the June 27 measures will continue until August and September due to the increase in housing mortgage loans. Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor Rhee Chang-yong speaks during a press briefing at the BOK headquarters in Jung District, central Seoul, on July 10. [JOINT PRESS CORPS] In particular, it is estimated that housing mortgage loans will surge to nearly 8 trillion won ($5.83 billion) in August this year, the highest level since August of last year, when the figure stood at 8.5 trillion won. Excessive household debt is a drag on consumption and broader economic growth. In a highly real estate-dependent economy like Korea’s, a future drop in housing prices could deepen consumption slumps and lead to bad debts at banks. If people cannot repay their debts, the asset soundness of banks that lent money using houses as collateral will also deteriorate. “Household debt now stands at nearly 90 percent of GDP, a critical threshold beyond which it begins to constrain consumption and growth,” Rhee warned. The government and BOK aim to reduce this ratio gradually to below 80 percent. Amid high inflation, shoppers look around discounted products at a market in Dongdaemun District, eastern Seoul, on July 6. [YONHAP] The uncertainty regarding the timing of additional interest rate cuts in the U.S. is also the background for this freeze. Despite the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy, economic indicators such as employment are still showing favorable trends. The market sees a high possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve will freeze interest rates at the end of July and slow the pace of rate cuts in the future. Several of the 19 Fed officials flagged inflation risks, with seven predicting no rate cuts this year, according to the June Federal Open Market Committee minutes. If Korea lowers its interest rate first and the interest rate gap with the United States widens to more than 2 percentage points, export companies may face difficulties due to the depreciation of the won. If the recovery in domestic demand is delayed and exports are also hit by U.S. tariffs, it is predicted that the economy may fail to grow even in the 1 percent range. A loan window at a bank in Seoul is seen on July 7, amid the implementation of strict lending regulations limiting housing mortgage loans. [YONHAP] Rhee mentioned on Thursday that private consumption is improving compared to the outlook in May, but construction investment has worsened. However, it is expected that the additional 32 trillion won supplementary budget plan, including the people's livelihood recovery consumption coupons, will prevent a further slowdown in the growth rate. The BOK estimated that this year's annual growth rate will rise by 0.1 percentage points from the 0.8 percent forecast presented in May due to this supplementary budget. The market is currently leaning toward a rate cut in August. Four out of the six BOK monetary policy board members are open to a rate cut within three months. However, the worst-case scenario, in which housing prices do not stabilize and the negative impact of tariffs increases, still needs consideration. “We are weighing the trade-off between growth and financial stability,” Rhee said, acknowledging the dilemma. “If that conflict intensifies, the board may become more divided in its views.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

743,From pain to rain: Heat wave expected to break on Sunday with return of downpours,"People walk in Jongno District, central Seoul, with portable electric fans amid heat advisories issued for most regions of Korea on July 10. [YONHAP] A scorching heat wave will persist across the Seoul metropolitan area through the weekend. But beginning Sunday, the extreme heat will break somewhat and bring a return of monsoon rains by mid-next week. Temperatures will reach as high as 36 degrees Celsius (96 degrees Fahrenheit) across the capital region and much of Korea through the weekend. After that, around Sunday, the two high-pressure systems that have fueled the extreme heat are forecast to break down, with monsoon rains likely to return, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) on Thursday. Related Article Livestock deaths skyrocket as record heat wave broils Korea Korean shipyards, steelmakers rush to keep workers safely cool amid brutal heat wave Korea likely to see record demand for power due to scorching heat Most of the country — excluding the east coast — remains under a heat wave advisory, with temperatures in the capital area hovering around 35 degrees Celsius on Thursday. Seoul recorded a high of 35.7 degrees Celsius, similar to the previous day, while Paju's Gwangtan-myeon in Gyeonggi reached 37.8 degrees and Gwangmyeong 37.6 degrees, based on automatic weather stations. This intense heat is due to a “heat dome” effect, in which the Korean Peninsula is trapped under two high-pressure systems — one from the North Pacific below and another from the Tibetan Plateau above. These systems act like a thermal blanket, preventing the heat generated under clear skies from dissipating. A haze rises from the road in front of Gwanghwamun Square in Jongno District, central Seoul, on July 10. [NEWS1] Heat to ease, just a little, starting Sunday The heat wave is expected to persist through Friday and Saturday, with highs reaching up to 36 degrees Celsius and easterly winds continuing to push heat warnings across the western part of the country. The pattern is forecast to take a slight shift around Sunday, as surrounding pressure systems begin to break down. “A trough from the north is expected to push down, weakening the high-pressure systems over the Korean Peninsula,” said Lee Chang-jae, a forecast analyst at the KMA. “This will open a pathway for tropical moisture to flow in, increasing the likelihood of heavy rainfall.” With winds shifting westward and more moisture entering the region, conditions will become hot and humid next week. Although actual temperatures may drop slightly, apparent temperatures will remain at dangerous levels, requiring continued vigilance against heat-related illnesses. The bottom of the Domacheon River near Obong Reservoir in Gangneung, Gangwon, is exposed on July 8 as the monsoon season was cut short this year. [NEWS1] Monsoon rains to return next week Rain is expected to return to the central region — including the capital and inland Gangwon — around Wednesday and Thursday next week. The rainfall is then expected to expand southward to the Chungcheong region, the southern provinces, and Jeju Island by July 18, due to an influx of tropical moisture. If moisture levels increase, rainfall may become heavier and more prolonged, potentially lasting through the weekend. This could help ease drought conditions in areas like Gangwon, which have suffered from a dry monsoon season. “Monsoon season is not yet over in the central region,” said KMA forecast analyst Woo Jin-gyu. “With the high-pressure systems weakening, we expect stationary fronts and troughs to pass through, bringing several more days of rain. That’s why we haven’t officially declared the end of the monsoon yet.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

744,"U.S. think tank proposes 'cutting all ground combat units' from Korea, says Seoul should 'defend itself'","The RC-12X Guardrail reconnaissance aircraft takes off from Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, on May 23.[NEWS1] A new U.S. think tank report called for slashing the number of U.S. troops in South Korea from around 28,500 to about 10,000, arguing that Seoul should take primary responsibility for its own defense as Washington repositions forces to counter China more effectively across the Indo-Pacific region. Dan Caldwell, former senior adviser to U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, called for the reduction of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) to 10,000 in a new report from think tank Defense Priorities. Related Article Top military officers of Korea, U.S. to meet amid USFK role change speculation Campbell warns substantial USFK troop adjustment will be 'misinterpreted' as reduced U.S. commitment Trump says Korea should pay for its own defense This proposal aligns with growing discussions in Washington about expanding the strategic flexibility of USFK following a May report by the Wall Street Journal suggesting that the United States is considering relocating 4,500 troops from Korea to other areas in the Indo-Pacific region. Observers expect the upcoming U.S. National Defense Strategy (NDS) report, to be released next month, may include plans to reduce and reconfigure the USFK's role. In a report titled “Aligning global military posture with U.S. interests” released Wednesday, Caldwell and Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, argued that “the U.S. military posture in East Asia should be realigned to focus on balancing Chinese power and protecting U.S. interests.” Caldwell and Kavanagh recommend shifting U.S. military forces away from South Korea to other regional locations, increasing reliance on allies and partners for defense and relocating the center of U.S. preparedness from the “First Island Chain” including Japan's Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines and northern Borneo to the more rearward “Second Island Chain,” consisting of Guam, Saipan and Palau. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, right, looks at U.S. President Donald Trump as he speaks during a bilateral dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in Washington on July 7. [REUTERS/YONHAP] ‘Withdraw 2nd Infantry Division, two fighter squadrons’ Caldwell and Kavanagh stated that this adjustment would return primary self-defense responsibility to South Korea. They cited a comment by then-Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby in May of last year, saying, “The fundamental fact is that North Korea is not a primary threat to the U.S.” and added that “South Korea has a significant conventional military advantage over its neighbor to the north and so should be able to effectively defend itself, even without U.S. support, if not immediately, then in the near term.” Colby, a key brain of the U.S. Department of Defense, is leading the establishment of the NDS. Specifically, Caldwell and Kavanagh proposed “Cutting all ground combat units not tied to base security from South Korea, along with Army signal, intelligence and headquarters units and some of their associated support and sustainment units.” U.S. military vehicles are parked at the U.S. military base in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi, on July 10. [YONHAP] “This would remove most of the 2nd Infantry Division from the peninsula, including the rotational BCT [battalion combat team] and Army combat aviation units,” they wrote. “In addition, the United States should cut airpower based in South Korea, moving two fighter squadrons from U.S. bases in South Korea back to the United States,” Caldwell and Kavanagh wrote. “Along with the fighter aircraft, about a third of air maintenance and other support units and personnel can also be returned stateside. In total, this would reduce the total U.S. military presence in South Korea by more than 50 percent, leaving about 10,000 personnel along with two fighter squadrons.” The remaining forces would focus primarily on support, logistics and maintenance, leaving wartime combat operations to the South Korean military. Elbridge Colby, under secretary of defense for policy, prepares for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 4. [AFP/YONHAP] ‘Allies still freeriding on U.S. security’ The writers also criticized what they described as ongoing “security freeriding” by allies and partners, writing that “Although South Korea has spent more heavily on defense than many U.S. allies, it continues to depend on the United States for some key combat support capabilities.” On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump singled out South Korea at a cabinet meeting, claiming that Seoul “makes a lot of money” and “has paid very little for its military defense,” adding that the United States has been providing support “for free.” Caldwell and Kavanagh justified USFK downsizing partly by noting that “Seoul has not offered the United States unrestricted contingency access to use its bases for operations elsewhere in the theater during a conflict,” adding, “Forces left in South Korea might be sidelined in the event of a regional war.” If conflict were to erupt elsewhere in the region — such as in the Taiwan Strait — U.S. forces stationed in Korea may not be usable due to Seoul’s reluctance. The report argues that U.S. global military posture, including the 200,000 troops stationed across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, needs comprehensive rebalancing based on four priorities: homeland defense, preventing regional hegemony, shifting burdens to allies and protecting U.S. economic security. Caldwell and Kavanagh criticized the current posture in Asia as overly offensive and vulnerable to conflict due to its proximity to China. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during a cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington on July 8. [AFP/YONHAP] Likely inclusion in NDS led by Colby The report is gaining attention amid the Lee Jae Myung administration’s efforts to pursue a broad “package deal” with the United States on trade, investment, procurement and security. It aligns closely with the views of Colby, who is leading the drafting of the upcoming NDS. Colby has repeatedly argued that South Korea should lead the defense against North Korea, while USFK should focus on deterring China. In an April 2024 interview with the JoongAng Ilbo, Colby said that South Korea should directly defend the peninsula, adding that all options, including nuclear armament, should be on the table. Elbridge Colby, U.S. under secretary of defense for policy, speaks during an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo at his office in Washington on April 23, 2024. [JOONGANG ILBO] Some have speculated that he is behind the U.S. Department of Defense’s recent pause in air defense and precision ammunition shipments to Ukraine and a potential review of the AUKUS agreement to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines — moves that reflect his strategic outlook. For these reasons, observers expect the new NDS to include a blueprint for downsizing and reconfiguring USFK. Meanwhile, at a seminar the same day, Center for Strategic and International Studies Korea Chair Victor Cha commented, “One key question is whether President Lee will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before meeting Trump.” Whom Lee meets first is will be a major indicator of his administration’s foreign policy direction.

745,"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on: Can the slimmer, stylus-free foldable win?","A display of Galaxy Z Fold 7, left, and Flip 7 unfolded in central Seoul on July 10. [LEE JAE-LIM] Samsung’s latest foldables — the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 — are sleeker, lighter and smarter. But that trimmed-down design comes with a trade-off: The dropping of the signature S Pen, previously a useful tool for hands-on functions such as note-taking and sketching. Still, the Korean tech giant believes that portability will help it pull further ahead of rivals like Google and Huawei in the foldable race it helped launch. The first impression of both the Fold 7 and Flip 7 is that they give off the feel of phones that have been ironed out — thinner, wider and more spread out than their predecessors. This will likely make up for the lack of pen, especially for those who are not avid stylus users. What may stop them, however, is the near-$2,000 price point. Samsung's foldables are getting pricier with every model — as are many lines worldwide — and for many, regardless of thinness, spending so much on a handset is unrealistic. No S Pen: A necessary compromise? What immediately stands out from Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the lack of support for the S Pen, an external gadget that has been included on the past four Fold generations. Since 2021’s Fold 3, the pen has hovered near the phone — but it has never truly been part of the model, which did not include a built-in slot such like those of the Note and S Ultra lines. Samsung is aware of the loss but regards it as one of the adjustments necessary to the phone’s weight loss. “What most foldable users seem to want now is a thinner, lighter device that delivers strong performance in a compact form,” said Samsung Electronics’ Kim Jae-hyuk, head of mobile experience, during a press event in the company’s Taepyeongro building in central Seoul on Thursday. The company may “consider” reintroducing the S Pen if the technology advances further to balance lightness with the function in the future, but for now, S Pen is off the market for Fold series following the company's struggle to make the stylus useful on the foldable line. The S Pen’s most prized Bluetooth function, which enabled it to act as a miniature remote control on other Samsung models, has never been available on the Fold series. Definite portability Samsung’s smartphone theme for this year is portability, continuing from the S25 Edge model released in May. The new models are even lighter than an 8-ounce to-go cup of coffee: The Fold 7 weighs 215 grams (7.58 ounces), and the Flip 7 weighs 188 grams. Folded, the Fold 7 is just 8.9 millimeters thick — significantly slimmer than the previous model’s 12.1 millimeters — and now resembles a bar even when closed. Both the cover and main displays have been widened, with the unfolded screen now stretching to 8 inches, an 11 percent increase over its predecessor. When fully open, the device is just 4.2 millimeters thick. A display of Galaxy Z Fold 7 unfolded in central Seoul on July 10. [LEE JAE-LIM] Surprisingly enough, the flattened phones did not feel flimsy, possibly due to their reinforced hinge design and sturdier, but still ultrathin glass. The wider screen would be great for YouTube watching and also seemed well-suited for reading e-books. The Flip 7 comes in at 13.7 millimeters when folded, slimmer than the Flip 6’s 14.9 millimeters. Its most notable physical upgrade is the expanded 4.1-inch cover screen, now stretching nearly edge-to-edge — a jump from the previous model’s 3.4 inches. When unfolded, the device is just 6.5 millimeters thick. The larger front screen may hold appeal to users who want quick access to messages, widgets and even full apps without the need to flip the phone open. Related Article Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7 bring latest foldable tech to forefront Samsung gears up for Galaxy Z Flip 7 launch with China hot on heels Samsung to unveil latest foldable smartphones at Galaxy Unpacked 2025 in New York A wider display for AI The brief preview did not allow time to test battery or check out other software functions. But a noticeable distinction of the Flip 7 is that it runs on Samsung’s in-house Exynos 2500 processor, which had briefly taken a grace period from the prior mainstream galaxy generations due to performance concerns. “One of the key considerations is whether it actually helps extend battery life through optimization and algorithms, and especially whether it can deliver satisfactory AI performance,” Kim said. “After conducting thorough internal testing, we saw significant improvements over the previous model in those concerned areas.” A display of Galaxy Z Flip 7 unfolded in central Seoul on July 10. [LEE JAE-LIM] Samsung employees demonstrated some of the upgraded features coming to Google's Gemini, which powers the Galaxy line. The wider display allows Gemini to better view the content of a user's interface and provide real-time context-aware assistance such as product suggestions, summaries and action recommendations. Gemini can be launched directly from the Flip 7's cover screen; the phone also supports Samsung's DeX for the first time. Both phones support voice commands, which employees demonstrated. On the Fold 7, an employee pulled up an online store and a fitness app showing running data, then asked Gemini to recommend the best running shoes. On the Flip 7, a voice command prompted Gemini to search for nearby restaurants and automatically add a reservation reminder using Samsung Reminder. In Flex Mode, the Flip 7 also supports real-time camera sharing with Gemini, allowing Google's model to provide visually informed assistance. Preorders for the new models begin on July 15, with global availability starting July 26. Each device comes with three color options: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is offered in Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow and Jet Black, and the Z Flip 7 replaces Silver Shadow with Coral Red. Both models also feature Mint as an online-exclusive color. Pricing starts at 2.38 million won ($1,736) for the Fold 7 and 1.49 million won for the Flip 7, both with 256GB of storage.

746,Ruling party lawmaker slams Trump's 'disrespect' for demanding Korea pay more for defense,"Jin Sung-joon, chief policymaker of the liberal Democratic Party, attends a meeting at the National Assembly in western Seoul on June 18. [YONHAP] A Korean lawmaker criticized U.S. President Donald Trump for being ""disrespectful"" for demanding that Korea and other allied countries bear a greater share of their defense costs. “It is an outrageous and excessive demand that shows no respect or courtesy for an ally,” Korean liberal Democratic Party (DP) Rep. Jin Sung-joon said during a policy coordination meeting held at the National Assembly in central Seoul on Thursday, referring to Trump’s recent remarks calling for $10 billion in defense contributions from Korea. Related Article Trump’s demand for sharp defense cost hike draws concern in Korea South Korea says it will comply with existing terms of defense cost-sharing deal with U.S. Defense minister nominee cites need to restore inter-Korean military pact “It is deeply regrettable that Trump is either unaware of the facts or is willfully distorting them,” said Jin. He also refuted Trump’s claim that the United States has 45,000 troops stationed in Korea, saying that the actual number is around 28,000. Trump also claimed that the United States provides military support to Korea for free, but Jin rebutted that Korea pays over 1 trillion won ($728 million) annually in defense cost-sharing. “When accounting for indirect costs such as base provision and the purchase of advanced weaponry, Korea’s burden far exceeds that of the United States,” said Jin. Jin also challenged Trump’s claim that defense costs were reduced at Korea’s request during the Joe Biden administration, saying, “In reality, the contribution increased and is set to keep rising with inflation.” He urged the Korean government to “correct the United States’ distorted perception” and work together to “set the record straight on the reality of defense cost-sharing.” U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) armored vehicles are seen in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi, on March 10. [YONHAP] Jin also addressed trade and investment, stating that Trump's past claim that Korea's average tariff rate is four times higher than the United States' is inaccurate. “Under the Korea-U.S. FTA, tariffs on most goods have been eliminated,” Jin said. “As of last year, the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports was only 0.79 percent. Much of Korea’s trade surplus with the United States is reinvested locally, contributing to U.S. high-tech industries, supply chains and job creation.” Jin concluded by stressing the need for a “comprehensive package deal” covering tariffs, nontariff barriers and defense costs to ensure a mutually beneficial balance of interests.

748,"Unfazed by Musk-Trump row, Korean investors boost leveraged Tesla bets","Tesla CEO Elon Musk gestures on stage as he prepares to speak inside the Capital One Arena on the inauguration day of Donald Trump's second presidential term, in Washington on Jan. 20. [YONHAP/ REUTERS] [BEHIND THE NUMBERS] Elon Musk’s feud with U.S. President Donald Trump and his announcement of the launch of a political party have sent Tesla shares into a tailspin, but some Korean investors are doubling down on the EV giant. Net purchases of Direxion Daily Tsla Bull 2X Shares (TSLL), a leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the United States seeking a twofold daily return on Tesla, totaled $58 million from only Monday through Wednesday, according to depository data. Trailing distantly was Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares, a leveraged ETF seeking a threefold daily return on a semiconductor sector index, with net purchases amounting to less than half that of TSLL. Figures for each day represent orders placed two trading days earlier. TSLL shed 13 percent on Monday after the billionaire's announcement the previous week that he would form the ""America Party"" after a fallout with Trump, while Tesla lost almost 7 percent. Korean investors on the day placed orders for $136 million worth of TSLL, and $146.9 million of Tesla. Despite the volatility, Tesla and its leveraged stock remain popular among yield-hungry investors able to tolerate high risk for high returns. ""Due to Musk’s unpredictable behavior, Tesla should be “best approached as a short-term trading stock,” said Lee Yong-wook, a Seoul-based office worker, who held TSLL for a quarter through July. “I think Musk’s unpredictability may actually present an opportunity, making Tesla an exceptionally appealing pick for short-term gainers."" Musk recognized the passion Koreans have for Tesla. In a social media post last July, Musk praised Koreans as “smart people” and noted that Tesla is the most widely held stock among Korean investors. That holds true even today. Korean investors held $19.89 billion worth of Tesla shares — the most among all foreign equities — as of Tuesday, roughly accounting for 2 percent of the EV carmaker's market value. That amount of holding is 45 percent more than that of far second Nvidia, which recently became the world’s first company to reach a market value of $4 trillion. “It really seems to be largely driven by psychology,” said Park Seung-jin, a Seoul-based senior analyst at Hana Securities, regarding Korean investors’ enthusiastic buying of Tesla. “Musk’s ongoing presentation of innovative and visionary stories — creating things that never existed before — is drawing investors in.” Park said that he found the structure and strategy of Musk’s brain-technology startup Neuralink, known for its brain implants, as well as Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX, innovative. Some investors also hold that belief. ""I tell myself never to look back, but for some reason, I keep coming back to Tesla,"" said Lee Jong-won, a 33-year-old office worker in Seoul. Since Lee started investing in U.S. stocks in 2020, the majority of the losses he incurred were from the EV maker. Most recently, he lost 10 percent of his Tesla investment. While holding it for a little more than a week through early July, he was restless, unable to sleep at night, watching news about Musk and his companies, including SpaceX, which launches rockets and spacecraft. ""Despite the recent stock price fall, I still believe in Musk's personal capability that may one day lead him to dominate entire industries, ranging from not just autonomous EVs but also humanoid robotics, defense and space."" A Tesla robotaxi drives on the street along South Congress Avenue in Austin on June 22. [YONHAP/ REUTERS ] Despite Musk’s milestones, his brand faces headwinds, including his clash with Trump. Musk’s criticism of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which pulls the plug on federal tax incentives for EVs, became the catalyst for their major fallout. Trump signed the bill into law on July 4. Tesla’s recent earnings have also been weak. Tesla missed Wall Street estimates, reporting a 20 percent plunge in automotive revenue in the first quarter from a year earlier. There is little optimism for its second quarter earnings, too, as the company posted global vehicle sales down 13.5 percent in the second quarter compared to a year ago, according to FactSet. The carmaker is set to announce its full financial results for the second quarter on July 23. “With the expiration of the EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act ending on September 30, there is a high possibility of contraction in the EV market,” said Esther Yim, a senior analyst at Samsung Securities. “Overcoming the challenges ultimately comes down to technological capability, and I believe that combining full self-driving with affordable models that cost below $30,000 can push a recovery in performance.""

Such a strategy could reignite investor confidence, especially among retail investors who continue to bet on Musk’s bold vision. “Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself,” said the loss-lamenting Lee, quoting Charlie Munger, the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, about Musk. “I believe in Musk, and honestly, I think I’ll buy Tesla again in the future when the market turns bullish.""

750,South Korea’s repatriation of six North Koreans hints at fragile channel of contact,"A vessel carrying North Korean returnees crosses into Northern waters in the East Sea on July 9. According to the Unification Ministry, the boat — carrying six North Korean men rescued south of the NLL in March and May — crossed the maritime border at 8:56 a.m. and met a North Korean patrol ship at 9:24 a.m. [MINISTRY OF UNIFICATION] [NEWS ANALYSIS] Six North Koreans returned to their homeland by boat on Wednesday, marking the first confirmed instance of repatriation under President Lee Jae Myung and also the first known direct human exchange between the two Koreas in months. On the surface, the repatriation was a routine act of humanitarianism: six fishermen who had drifted into South Korean waters earlier this year were rescued, interviewed and sent home at their own request. But to some analysts, the carefully calibrated gesture may suggest something more — a subtle but possible signal of coordination, even as formal communications between the two Koreas remain severed. The repatriation also reflects the early contours of Lee’s more conciliatory approach toward North Korea, contrasting with the hawkish stance of his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol. While Lee has maintained a firm stance on deterrence and alliance coordination, he has also taken steps — including halting loudspeaker broadcasts and curbing anti-North leaflet launches — that signal a willingness to reduce tensions and reengage. A small North Korean wooden boat is towed to a port in Yangyang County on Oct. 24, 2023. The file photo is unrelated to the July 9 repatriation. [YONHAP] A return without a word The six men in their 30s and 40s — two rescued in the Yellow Sea in March and four in the East Sea in May — expressed desires to return to the North, according to South Korean officials. “We notified the UN Command through the established channel last week and again this week, sharing coordinates and timing,"" explained a senior Unification Ministry official, speaking on background, on Wednesday. The UN Command, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, still administers parts of the armistice agreement and remains a conduit for technical notices to the North. Despite the silence, Seoul went ahead. The six were escorted on a wooden vessel across the de facto maritime border. When they crossed the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the East Sea, a North Korean patrol boat and a fishing vessel were waiting and took custody of the men. The boat carrying the six men safely docked at a North Korean port, a South Korean government official later confirmed Thursday. As of Thursday afternoon, Pyongyang offered no public comment. The decision to proceed without explicit consent from North Korea drew scrutiny from some observers. Repatriating people into the custody of a hostile state without a confirmed reception carries both humanitarian and political risks. “We wouldn’t have proceeded if we thought they wouldn’t be received,” said the ministry official. “Based on experience, and ongoing communication through the UN Command, we had reasonable confidence the North would be there. Had Pyongyang not shown up, the official added, the South was prepared to bring the men back. Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies, said the government’s swift decision to proceed, even in the absence of formal approval from Pyongyang, reflected a conscious effort to avoid unnecessary speculation from both the North and international human rights bodies. “Had Seoul waited indefinitely for Pyongyang’s reply, it could have created another generation of long-term unconverted prisoners,” he said. A North Korean fisherman resists repatriation at Panmunjom in November 2019 who was forcibly returned to the North after allegedly murdering 16 crewmates. The men expressed intent to defect but were deported within five days. [MINISTRY OF UNIFICATION] A contrast with the 2019 forced return The latest repatriation of fishermen under the Lee administration differs from a still-contentious case from November 2019. Then, under the liberal Moon Jae-in administration, two North Korean fishermen captured in South Korean waters were forcibly sent back to the North via Panmunjom despite expressing a desire to defect. The backlash was immediate and fierce. Human rights groups condemned the decision. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also criticized the move, and even some members of Moon’s own party expressed concern. The government claimed the men had confessed to murdering 16 of their crewmates and were thus “serious criminals” undeserving of asylum. They were sent back within five days, and later reports indicated they had likely been executed. This time, the Unification Ministry emphasized that the government carried out the case entirely on ""humanitarian grounds"" in accordance with the ""individuals’ expressed will"" to repatriate. The method of transfer was also different. Unlike the case in 2019, which took place via the heavily fortified and symbolically charged inter-Korean border village that hosted the Moon-Kim Jong-un summit the year before, Wednesday’s repatriation occurred by sea. According to officials, the approach was chosen in part to minimize direct confrontation. “A land repatriation through Panmunjom would have required face-to-face contact, which we judged to be inappropriate given the North’s lack of a clear response,"" the ministry official said. ""The maritime route was chosen for its relative safety and indirectness.” Even so, the repatriation was the longest delayed. In previous cases since 2010, North Koreans without intent to defect were typically returned within a month. This time, it took over four months. Some have suggested that South Korea’s leadership vacuum earlier in the year, marked by Yoon's impeachment and a snap election, may have slowed the decision-making process. ""If anything,"" the ministry official noted, ""the process could have been handled more efficiently had communication channels between the two Koreas been functioning normally"" — a reminder, perhaps, of just how constrained inter-Korean coordination remains. Unification Ministry spokesperson Koo Byoung-sam speaks during a regular briefing at the Government Complex Seoul on July 7. [NEWS1] A quiet step forward However, the Unification Ministry was careful not to overstate the implications of the operation, stressing that the repatriation had never been intended as a political gesture or an attempt to improve ties with Pyongyang. Although government officials insist the move was apolitical, some North Korea analysts argue that the moment could mark the start of something more significant. Yang interpreted the North’s participation as a kind of tacit acknowledgment of recent South Korean gestures, including the suspension of loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and the curbing of anti-North leaflet launches. ""This shows a pattern of reciprocal tension reduction,” he added. Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the handover illustrates how the Lee administration’s humanitarian overtures are drawing limited but notable cooperation from the North, pointing out that the North proactively dispatched vessels in this case suggests a “cautious trust” in Seoul’s new direction. Lim tied the moment to other recent moves, such as the South’s decision to authorize certain private organizations' engagement with the North — a reversal of restrictions under former President Yoon. While full-fledged dialogue remains premature, Lim said, if both sides build on it, the repatriation might even lead to renewed discussions on reviving the September 2018 military agreement. President Lee Jae Myung holds his first press conference on July 3 at the Blue House in central Seoul. [YONHAP] Lee himself has indicated a willingness to engage. In his first official press conference last week, Lee likened the inter-Korean relationship to that of a married couple, stressing that ""even if we're angry, we must listen to each other"" and ""even during war, diplomacy continues."" He emphasized that restoring dialogue and reducing damage through negotiation was essential to building peace and coexistence on the Korean Peninsula. Lee also noted that, despite deep mistrust, North Korea had responded positively to the South’s unilateral suspension of loudspeaker broadcasts. “Just like that, we need to ease tensions step by step,” he said. Lim said the opportunity should not be wasted. “Seoul should use the repatriation as an opportunity to build momentum for resumption of dialogue,” he said.

[HANWHA OCEAN] Major Korean shipyards and steelmakers are implementing emergency measures to keep outdoor workers cool by extending break times and deploying mobile cooling units, as temperatures continue to exceed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) across the country. Hanwha Ocean introduced mobile cooling buses for the first time this year, serving as temporary cooling centers, and plans to concentrate these buses at sites with heavy workloads, according to the shipbuilder on Thursday.

753,'Bottari artist' Kimsooja receives French Order of Arts and Letters,"Contemporary artist Kimsooja speaks during a ceremony for receiving the French Order of Arts and Letters at the rank of Officier at the French Embassy in Seoul on July 9. [KIMSOOJA STUDIO] Contemporary artist Kimsooja received the French Order of Arts and Letters at the rank of officier on Wednesday at the French Embassy in Seoul. Established in 1957 by the French Ministry of Culture, the Order of Arts and Letters is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the arts or literature. Related Article Transforming a city’s memories: Works by Kimsooja take on a new context across Poitiers, France Kimsooja works to connect dots The order has three ranks: chevalier, officier and commandeur , with commandeur being the highest. This is Kimsooja’s second decoration; she was previously awarded the rank of chevalier in 2017. Born in Daegu in 1957, Kimsooja is known as the bottari artist in Korea — a nickname derived from her unique implementation of Korea's traditional cloth bundles used for wrapping and transporting belongings, which she reinterprets as symbolic carriers of memory, identity and migration in her conceptual and performance-based art. She studied painting at Hongik University. She began as a painter but gained recognition in the early 1990s for her installation works using fabrics such as bojagi (traditional wrapping cloth), bed covers and old clothes collected from the streets. She stitches these materials together and wraps objects in them, transforming everyday textiles into sculptural art. Since participating in the Venice Biennale in 1993, Kimsooja has showcased her work at leading cultural institutions including New York’s Museum of Modern Art, Documenta in Kassel, the Lyon Biennale and the Guggenheim Museum. In France, she held a solo exhibition at the Centre Pompidou-Metz, completed a permanent stained-glass installation at Metz Cathedral and carried out an urban project in Poitiers, among other notable contributions.

[KIMSOOJA STUDIO] Most prominently, from March 20 to Sept. 2 of last year, she became the first Korean artist to be granted carte blanche at the Bourse de Commerce — Pinault Collection in Paris. The carte blanche designation allows an artist full creative control of an exhibition. For the show, Kimsooja installed 418 mirrors on the floor of the museum’s iconic rotunda for the work “To Breathe,” and displayed other pieces such as “A Needle Woman” and “Thread Routes” in the museum’s glass cases and basement. “My relationship with France began in 1984, when I received a government scholarship to study lithography for six months at the École des Beaux-Arts,” Kimsooja said during the ceremony. “Thanks to the sustained interest and generous support of the French government and both public and private art institutions, I have been able to continue my work.

754,"Lazy Koreans? Only 1 in 4 adults engage in strenuous activity, health data warns.","A jogger walks through sprinklers on a path in Jung District, Daegu on July 3. [NEWS1] Only about one in four Korean adults engages in physical activity strenuous enough to leave them out of breath. Residents of major cities, women and youngsters are especially bad, placing Korea near the bottom globally for physical inactivity, according to new public health data. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) released on Thursday an analysis of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity rates among Korean adults, based on annual data from the Community Health Survey. Related Article Training under trains: A gym inside Ttukseom Station offers a ticket to convenient workouts Get healthy, conveniently, as CU gets into health supplements Children get active on getting active as they make a policy push for their right to health A total of 26.6 percent of Korean adults engaged in moderate to high-intensity physical activity last year, according to the report. This marks a recovery from the 2021 low of 19.7 percent during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the rate remains far from ideal. The KDCA defines the practice rate as the percentage of people who engage in high-intensity activity — at least 20 minutes per day, three or more days a week — or moderate-intensity activity — at least 30 minutes per day, five or more days a week. Moderate-intensity activities include table tennis and badminton, while high-intensity activities include running, hiking and carrying heavy loads. From 2021 to 2024, 12 of the 17 metropolitan and provincial governments showed consistent increases in physical activity. Sejong saw the greatest improvement, jumping from 17.5 percent in 2021 to 29.1 percent last year — a rise of 11.6 percentage points. Conversely, Gwangju, North Jeolla, North Gyeongsang, South Gyeongsang and Jeju showed inconsistent changes with little improvement. Residents of an apartment complex exercise at the gym within the complex in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on June 30. [NEWS1] There were also clear differences based on residential environment. Last year, the rate in metropolitan areas was 26.5 percent, lower than in rural areas where the rate stood at 28.2 percent. This trend has been consistent over the years. The urban environment — centered around cars, public transportation, sedentary office jobs and limited time for exercise — is seen as a major factor behind the lower activity levels in cities. In contrast, higher rates in rural areas are likely due to the physically demanding nature of agricultural and fishing work. The gap by gender was also significant: 30.2 percent of men met the activity threshold, compared to only 19.5 percent of women. By age, people in their 20s had the highest rate at 32.3 percent, while those aged 70 and older had the lowest at 13.8 percent. Men's activity levels declined with age, while women in their 40s and 50s were the most active, with younger and older women less so. This suggests young men are particularly likely to engage in moderate or high-intensity exercise. Gymgoers exercise inside an indoors gym in Goyang, Gyeonggi, on Feb. 27. [NEWS1] Compared to other countries, Korea’s inactivity problem is especially stark. The global average rate of insufficient physical activity among adults is 31.3 percent, according to the World Health Organization. In Korea, that figure was 58.1 percent as of 2022 — nearly double the global average — ranking 191st out of 195 countries. This rate reflects the percentage of adults who do not engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity physical activity per week. The KDCA emphasized the health benefits of activities such as hiking, running and cycling, noting their potential to prevent chronic illnesses and improve mental health. “It’s important to start with light exercise and gradually build up to more vigorous activity,” said KDCA commissioner Jee Young-mee. “Even small steps can make a big difference when done consistently as part of daily life.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

755,Rare Manchurian weasel spotted for first time in eight years,"A manchurian weasel, first discovered in Mount Jiri National Park on July 1, 2017, flees from a person. [KOREA NATIONAL PARK SERVICE] A Manchurian weasel, one of the rarest mammals on the Korean Peninsula, has been spotted in Mount Jiri National Park for the first time in eight years, the Ministry of Environment said Thursday. Known for its small, endearing appearance, the Manchurian weasel is the smallest carnivorous mammal in the world. Related Article Back from the brink: Endangered bird species successfully reproduces in South Gyeongsang Endangered snake found abandoned in hotel room rescued by authorities A rare tweet: Endangered black wood pigeon observed in Ulsan The Korea National Park Service (KNPS) discovered the weasel during routine wildlife monitoring on Mount Jiri last month, according to the ministry. The service successfully photographed an adult weasel peeking out from between rocks on June 26. The Manchurian weasel measures just 12 to 18 centimeters (4.72 to 7.09 inches) in length, with a body width of around 3 centimeters and a weight of 50 to 150 grams (1.76 to 5.29 ounces). It is the smallest member of the Mustelidae family, known in Korean as the “small weasel” group. The subspecies was first discovered in 1927 in Musan County, North Hamgyong Province, and is named after the region. The species typically inhabits high-altitude burrows, rock crevices and logs. Its rapid movements make it difficult to spot. Its brown summer coat turns white in winter, an adaptation that helps it evade predators and hunt prey in snowy alpine environments. A manchurian weasel hides among rocks after being first discovered in Mount Jiri National Park on July 1, 2017. [KOREA NATIONAL PARK SERVICE] Though it may appear docile — with short rounded ears, wide eyes and an elongated body — the Manchurian weasel is a fierce predator. It primarily feeds on small rodents, with a single weasel consuming 2,000 to 3,000 annually. It can also hunt prey larger than itself, such as small birds and juvenile rabbits, and feed on amphibians, reptiles and insects, playing a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. The species was once widely distributed across Korea, excluding Jeju and Ulleung Island, but is now critically endangered. The KNPS estimates that only a handful survive in 10 national parks, including Mount Seorak and Mount Odae. The population has plummeted due to overhunting for fur, habitat loss from development and the effects of climate change.

756,"Food, scenery are rich people's top priorities when booking hotels, Marriott survey finds","Oriol Montal, managing director of luxury for the Asia-Pacific region excluding China at Marriott International [MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL] At luxury hotels like St. Regis and JW Marriot, amenities like food, wellness and natural beauty are no longer just an add-ons — they're becoming essential parts of the hospitality experience for travelers, according to Oriol Montal, managing director of luxury for the Asia-Pacific region excluding China at Marriott International. “Over the past few years, we have seen a big, big change on what is luxury hospitality,” Montal said during a video interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. “While it used to be about consumption, this has moved on to experiences, personalization and authenticity. Guests want to experience the culture and different destinations.” Related Article Marriott Bonvoy teams up with BMW Ladies Championship 2024 in Korea JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul voted best hotel in North Asia by Condé Nast Traveler Marriott opens new AC Hotel in Gunpo for high-quality business stays The Marriott International's Luxury Group recently surveyed 1,750 high-net-worth (HNW) travelers across Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, Japan and Thailand from March 14 to April 17, including 250 respondents from each market. Ninety percent of travelers cited wellness experiences as a key booking factor, up 10 percent from 80 percent the year before. As part of its initiative to meet this demand, Marriott is introducing what's called Mindful Rooms — wellness-focused accommodations debuting this October at JW Marriott Tokyo. The rooms will gradually launch across JW Marriott properties worldwide. Marriott’s wellness focus began earlier with the launch of Serene Spaces, tranquil areas in its properties. The hotel chain is also catering more toward outdoorsy travelers, who are emerging as a powerful driver of luxury travel. Ninety-two percent of respondents said being close to nature is a key travel priority. Marriott’s efforts to incorporate nature into luxury stays are evident at JW Marriott Jeju Resort & Spa, which offers “unique experiences related to nature,” said Montal. At that resort, guests can take meditative strolls along the Jeju Olle Trails and participate in bulmeong , or campfire watching. JW Marriott Jeju Resort & Spa [JW MARRIOTT JEJU RESORT & SPA] Despite the growing popularity of wellness and nature as booking priorities, gastronomy remains the top driver of luxury travel in the region. Marriott is keeping pace by emphasizing both fine dining and locally inspired cuisine at Korean properties. JW Marriott Jeju’s omakase restaurant Yeoumul, for example, serves seafood caught by haenyeo , Jeju’s female sea divers. Marriott hasn't left that culinary focus behind while expanding its wellness offerings, Montal added. Its multicity Luxury Dining Series, launched last year, runs from July to September and will take place in seven destinations across the Asia-Pacific region, stopping in JW Marriott Jeju Resort & Spa from July 17 to 20. “It’s two to three days of celebrating food and beverage,” said Montal. New traveler demographics are also shaping the market, Montal added. Once a niche category, the share of Guardian Trailsetters — or solo parents traveling with their children — has risen from 15 percent to 24 percent in just one year. Venture Travelists, or those who combine business exploration with leisure, are also on the rise. Bleisure — the blending of business and leisure — is especially prevalent among HNW Korean travelers, with 86 percent now combining business with personal travel. In response, Marriott has adapted properties like the Josun Palace to include full-service business centers for hybrid travelers. “They enjoy what the city has to offer, but they’re also keeping their eyes open for opportunities,” Montal said. Technology also plays a key role in the hotel selection process for high-net worth Korean travelers, with 42 percent considering high-tech amenities “very important” when choosing a hotel. Marriott has long offered online check-in and digital room keys through its Marriot Bonvoy app, favorites among its regular guests. Marriott currently operates 37 hotels across Korea, with 12 more in the pipeline. In Gangwon Province, two new luxury resorts — JW Marriott Mangsang Beach Resort & Spa and The Luxury Collection Mangsang Beach Resort & Spa — are also scheduled to open. “It's our commitment to supporting the growth of tourism in the country,” Montal said. “We truly believe that we’re helping in giving the reason for international travelers to get to know those locations.” BY WOO JI-WON [woo.jiwon@joongang.co.kr]",2025-07-10,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-07-10/culture/foodTravel/Food-scenery-are-rich-peoples-top-priorities-when-booking-hotels-Marriott-survey-finds/2348039,JoongAng Ilbo (중앙일보),China,Business
757,"From men in floral aprons to young romance, hit North Korean drama reflects country's changing social norms","A man in the North Korean drama “A New Spring in the Field of Manchurian Cranes” wears a floral apron as he serves a meal to his wife and daughter. [KOREAN CENTRAL TELEVISION] North Korea’s latest television drama has wrapped up after drawing notable domestic attention for its portrayal of shifting social norms — from men donning flower aprons to young couples openly navigating romance. The state-run monthly magazine Kumsugangsan reported in its July issue that the 22-episode series ""A New Spring in the Field of Manchurian Cranes,"" which aired on Korean Central Television (KCTV) from April 16 to June 24, recorded high viewership.

Kyong-mi answers a call from her boyfriend Young-deok in a scene in North Korean drama “A New Spring in the Field of Manchurian Cranes.” [KOREAN CENTRAL TELEVISION] Produced by a creative unit of the television drama studio under the state's film bureau, “A New Spring in the Field of Manchurian Cranes” stood out for breaking from the often rigid emotional palette of North Korean screenwriting. The drama drew attention for its different sensibilities and narrative style compared to previous works, according to Kumsugangsan. One notable scene shows a husband, wearing a flower-patterned apron, serving a meal to his wife and daughter. The family accepts this without fuss, a striking depiction given that North Korea's patriarchal society is traditionally viewed as resistant to men taking on household chores. The magazine noted this portrayal breaks with traditional stereotypes.

[KOREAN CENTRAL TELEVISION] Romantic storylines also took center stage in a way rarely seen in the North’s cultural productions, which generally lean heavily on ideological messaging. The drama follows Kyong-mi, an agricultural researcher played by Ri Yu-gyong, and Young-deok, a prosecutor played by Choe Hyon, who have been dating for over four years.

761,"For Judoka Kim Ha-yun, world championship gold isn't a comeback, it's just the beginning","Judoka Kim Ha-yun poses during an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo at Taereung Training Center in northern Seoul on July 4. [JOONGANG ILBO] Kim Ha-yun showcased her skills by winning the judo world championship title this summer, just months after injury sidelined her from the national team — now she is setting her sights on the Asian Games and hoping her beloved baseball team, the Lotte Giants, can end their own decades-long Korean Series title drought too. The 25-year-old judoka captured gold in the women’s over-78 kilogram (172-pound) division at the World Judo Championships in Budapest on June 20 by beating Japan’s Arai Mao in the final with three shido penalties, earning Korea's first gold in the division since 1991, when Moon Ji-yoon won in the then-over-72 kilogram category.

I can’t let my guard down just because I won the world championships. Now I feel more pressure to stay at the top.” The odds were firmly stacked against her. After the Paris Olympics last August, she suffered back-to-back knee and shoulder injuries and was sidelined from competition for nearly six months. judoka Kim Ha-yun, left, poses during an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo at Taereung Training Center in northern Seoul on July 4. [JOONGANG ILBO] She skipped international events, including the Paris Grand Slam this February, and lost her top national team spot to 18-year-old prospect Lee Hyun-ji. Kim only earned a chance to compete at the world championships because the Korea Judo Association designated her weight class as a strategic division, allowing two athletes to participate, sending her to the tournament as the second seed. Her rapid return to form stemmed from an unconventional training decision. While most female judokas spar with middle or high school boys to manage strength disparity, Kim insisted on training with two adult male coaches — both former national team members: Kim Jeong-hoon from the 100-kilogram division and Kwon Young-woo from 81-kilogram division. Top-tier competitors in Kim’s weight class often exceed 130 kilograms. Kim Ha-yun relied on precision and power conditioning with her coaches. “Every time I stepped on the mat with Ha-yun, I told myself, ‘I’m still an active athlete,’” Kim Jeong-hoon said. That training helped her defeat Lee Hyun-ji — who weighs 138 kilograms — in the quarterfinals en route to the title. Kim Ha-yun celebrates after beating Mao Arai of Japan to win the final of women's 78-kilogram category of the World Judo Championships in Budapest on June 19. [EPA/YONHAP] “I learned how to handle bigger opponents without needing to bulk up,” Kim said. “Now, I feel confident going up against anyone.” Her resurgence sets the stage for a high-stakes rematch with Lee for Korea’s sole spot at the upcoming Asian Games. “We’re close, and training together is so brutal that we’ve cried and cheered each other on,” Kim said. “But only one of us gets to go. I need to win when we face off.” Kim is known for her clutch performances. She was the only Korean judoka — man or woman — to win gold at the Hangzhou Asian Games in 2023. At the Paris Olympics, she earned bronze, becoming the first Korean woman in her weight class to medal at the Games since Kim Sun-young’s bronze in 2000. Born in Busan, Kim is also a die-hard fan of the Giants, her hometown baseball team. After winning gold in Budapest, she raised her right hand and flashed the team’s “promise ceremony” gesture — a thumb-and-pinky wave made famous by Giants infielder Na Seung-yeup. “It took 34 years for Korea to win in this weight class again,” she said. “The Giants haven’t won in 33 years. I really hope this is the year for them.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

""We’re working hard to raise the level of product completeness within the innovative device category and aim to launch [the device] within this year,"" said Roh Tae-moon, acting head of Samsung Electronics’ Device eXperience (DX) Division, on Wednesday, in regards to the Project Moohan headset. Related Article Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7 bring latest foldable tech to forefront Samsung Electronics acquires U.S. digital health firm Xealth Samsung Electronics posts 4.6 trillion won operating profit for Q2, down 56% on year The remarks were made at a press conference in New York following Galaxy Unpacked 2025, where the tech giant launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. The executive revealed the plans as part of Samsung’s plan to stay ahead in the AI era by advancing hardware that brings AI into the hands of more people. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in daily life, smartphones will play an even more vital role, according to Roh. ""Samsung Electronics will continue to introduce increasingly innovative form factors that lead the AI era,"" Roh said. ""As AI evolves, the smartphone paradigm is shifting from being touch-centric to one that revolves around AI and multimodal interaction."" Samsung opened what it called the mobile AI era by introducing AI features on the Galaxy S24 last year. With its latest foldables, the company aims to demonstrate how hardware can evolve to optimize AI experiences. ""The camera is no longer just a tool for taking pictures. It’s becoming a true AI partner that understands what you see and responds in real time,"" Roh said. Samsung also plans to dramatically expand the reach of Galaxy AI. ""Last year, we aimed to bring AI capabilities to 200 million Galaxy devices. This year, we’re doubling that target to 400 million,"" he said. On the question of charging for AI, Roh indicated Samsung has no immediate plans. ""We’ve decided to keep core features related to basic device use free for the time being,"" he said. ""Some customers may want to use premium versions from our partners, but that’s not something we can decide alone. We’re still discussing it."" Roh Tae-moon, acting head of Samsung Electronics' Device eXperience Division, delivers a keynote speech at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2025 in New York on July 9. [SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS] 'Exynos is sufficient' The new Z Flip 7 features Samsung’s in-house Exynos 2500 processor built with a 3-nanometer process by Samsung Foundry. The chip did not make it into the Galaxy S25 series earlier this year due to yield and performance concerns. Its inclusion in the Flip is seen as a renewed test that could impact Samsung Foundry’s ability to attract customers. ""For flagship models, we choose the processor that’s most competitive and appropriate at the time,"" Roh said. ""We determined that Exynos showed sufficient performance and that it was suitable for the Flip."" As Chinese brands like Honor and Xiaomi roll out their own foldables and Apple is rumored to launch its first foldable next year, Samsung believes it made the right bet by entering the segment early. ""We thought this would become an important category, which is why we launched foldables in 2019. That judgment was correct,"" Roh said. ""For foldables to become a mainstream category, many companies need to participate and compete."" Roh Tae-moon, acting head of Samsung Electronics' Device eXperience Division, delivers a keynote speech at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2025 in New York on July 9. [SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS] Expansion into digital health On Monday, Samsung announced its acquisition of U.S. digital health care company Xealth. ""We’re accelerating efforts to build a platform that connects everyday health data with medical services at hospitals,"" Roh said. ""This will lay the groundwork for closing the information gap between wearable devices and hospital records."" He also said the company remains open to additional acquisitions to ""strengthen its competitiveness."" Roh sounded confident about handling trade uncertainties, such as possible tariffs under the Donald Trump administration. ""Samsung’s strength is having multiple global production sites, which lets us quickly assess and respond to changes in key countries’ trade policies or market conditions,"" he said. ""We’ll leverage that to stay competitive."" Earlier in the week, Samsung reported disappointing preliminary earnings, with operating profit for the second quarter down roughly 56 percent from a year earlier. Roh attributed this mainly to the fading impact of earlier flagship launches. ""Sales were relatively down in the second quarter because the boost from new flagship products tapered off,"" he said. ""We’ll work to improve product completeness and ensure timely supply so that our performance can recover."" Correction, July 10, 2025: Corrected the name of the headset.

770,Food safety authorities antsy over use of ants as garnish at restaurant,"Ants to be used as garnish are stored in a dish at a restaurant that was investigated by food safety authorities. [JOONGANG ILBO] Authorities caught a restaurant in Korea using ants in its dishes without proper authorization, violating food safety regulations. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said on Thursday that it referred a restaurant operator and the associated business entity to prosecutors for violating the Food Sanitation Act. Related Article The world's oldest restaurant faces a challenge from another Madrid tavern that says its even older Desperate restaurant owners turn to robots, day laborers amid worker shortage Businesses targeted by fraudsters posing as political aides to make lavish restaurant reservations The ministry launched an investigation after spotting blog posts and social media content showing a specific restaurant serving dishes topped with ants. Under current Korean regulations, only 10 insect species — including locusts and mealworms — are approved as edible. Ants are not recognized as a legal ingredient. Investigators from the ministry's Central Investigation Team for Food Safety Crimes found that the operator imported two types of dried ant products from the United States and Thailand using international mail from April 2021 to November 2024. The restaurant used three to five ants as garnish on certain menu items to add acidity from April 2021 to January this year. Over the course of three years and nine months, the restaurant served roughly 12,000 such dishes, generating approximately 120 million won ($87,400) in revenue. “To use ants as food, businesses must obtain temporary approval for standards and specifications under food safety regulations,” a Ministry of Food and Drug Safety official said. “We have shared the results of this investigation with the relevant local government and requested administrative action.” Translated from the JoongAng Ilbo using generative AI and edited by Korea JoongAng Daily staff.

[VNL] The Korean women’s volleyball team suffered a 3-1 loss to Poland in the Volleyball Nations League (VNL) in Chiba, Japan, on Wednesday, failing to add a single point to avoid possible relegation. Korea won the first set 25-18, but that proved to be the only set the country took, as the squad lost the second set 25-19 and the third set 25-14.

The squad still saw three players racking up double-digit points in Wednesday’s match, with Lee Seon-woo scoring 21 points and Kang So-hwi and Lee Da-hyeon both at 13. Korea will have to bounce back in their three remaining VNL matches to avoid relegation, as adopted this year in the VNL. The last-place team at the end of the preliminary stage, which ends next week, loses its eligibility to compete in next year’s VNL. The top eight teams, on the other hand, join the knockout stage. Korea sits at the bottom of the 18-team preliminary stage table with four points, having won a single match and suffered two 3-2 losses as of Thursday. The squad’s only win comes from a 3-2 victory over Canada last month, which earned Korea two points. The two 3-2 losses against the Czech Republic and Dominican Republic added two more points for Korea, as the losing side grabs one point from a 3-2 loss in volleyball, while the winners take two.

773,'Sub me off!': Heat wave hits Club World Cup as leagues around the globe try to cope,"Fluminense players cool off during a water break in a Club World Cup quarterfinal match between Fluminense and Al Hilal in Orlando, Florida, on July 4. [AP/YONHAP] Athletes across the globe are waging a fierce battle against relentless heat waves that have gripped much of the planet. In the United States, host of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, an oppressive heat dome has pushed daytime temperatures in the eastern region into the mid-30s degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). After Juventus fell 1-0 to Real Madrid in a round of 16 clash in Miami on July 1, Juventus manager Igor Tudor revealed, “10 players asked to be substituted,” adding that ""the exhaustion was incredible."" Teams are allowed up to five substitutions per match, making that flood of requests a stark indication of how unbearable the conditions were. The temperature stood at 30 degrees Celsius with 70 percent humidity at kickoff. Borussia Dortmund manager Niko Kovac also struggled to cope after his side’s match in Cincinnati. “I’m sweating like I’ve just come out of a sauna,” he said. Chelsea's Cole Palmer cools down during the second half cooling break in a match against Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 8. [REUTERS/YONHAP] FIFA has scheduled many games at noon or 3 p.m. to cater to European prime-time TV audiences. Mike Tipton, a professor of applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth, urged organizers to rethink their approach for next year’s North and Central America World Cup. They should consider kicking the men's World Cup final off at 9 a.m.,” he told BBC Sport. In St. Louis, where temperatures topped 36 degrees Celsius last month, Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz vomited on the field during an MLB game. The Athletic cited experts who warned that soaring heat leads to increased heart rates. Premier League footballers typically lose around two liters (half a gallon) of sweat per match, but in hot and humid weather, that figure can reach five liters, the outlet reported. Spectators under the blazing sun face their own risks, including heat exhaustion and heatstroke. At Wimbledon in London, temperatures hit 32.3 degrees Celsius on opening day. The heat proved too much for some fans, forcing a temporary halt when a spectator collapsed. NC Dinos’ Kim Ju-won cools off with an ice pack during a game against the Hanwha Eagles at Hanwha Life Eagles Park in Daejeon on July 2. [NEWS1] The heat wave has also taken a toll on attendance in Korea. Just 4,426 fans turned up at Yongin Mireu Stadium for the men’s East Asian Football Federation E-1 Championship match between Korea and China. Even without overseas-based stars, that was an unusually low turnout for a senior international match. Tournament organizers have introduced cooling measures. If the temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius, officials allow up to three-minute “cooling breaks” at the 30-minute marks of each half in addition to halftime. Even when it is cooler, referees grant “drinks breaks” to help players stay hydrated. KBO teams rolled out emergency measures on Tuesday to cope with the searing heat. They extended the traditional fifth-inning stretch from four minutes to 10 minutes. They also pushed Sunday start times from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. for games scheduled between Sept. 1 and 14, scrapping doubleheaders in that period. If the temperature tops 35 degrees Celsius for two consecutive days, games will be canceled altogether. Some teams and players around the world are taking it a step further by preparing for extreme heat as an inevitable reality. England’s national football team has been training in heated tents ahead of the North and Central America World Cup to simulate sweltering conditions, according to the BBC.

774,Snack-intolerant: IBD in children poses unique challenges,"Professor Shim Jung-ok of Seoul National University Hospital [JOONGANG ILBO] When children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reach adolescence, their fight against the chronic condition often intensifies — not just physically, but emotionally, as they grapple with growth delays, dietary restrictions and a sense of isolation that can lead to depression. ""Children who follow their treatment well and carefully avoid certain foods sometimes rebel during puberty — skipping their medication, eating spicy instant noodles and ending up with bloody stools. It’s heartbreaking,"" said Shim Jung-ok, a professor of pediatrics at Seoul National University Hospital, in an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo. Related Article Novo Nordisk Korea, SNU's Bundang Hospital to collaborate on chronic disorder R&D Six in 10 SNU medical students will return to studies, survey suggests Gov't probes SNU medical school for letting students go on leave Shim was describing the challenges faced by pediatric patients with IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. These conditions cause chronic inflammation in the digestive tract, have no clear cause and are difficult to treat. Experts suspect environmental factors, such as the consumption of processed foods, may contribute. Over the past decade, the number of children with IBD has nearly doubled in Korea. According to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, the number of pediatric IBD patients rose from 4,149 in 2015 to 7,106 in 2024. In addition to bloody stools, symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain and appetite loss, as well as fatigue, anemia and arthritis. These complications can disrupt daily life — students may need to suddenly leave class, skip exams or miss trips. Poor nutrient absorption can also slow growth, leaving children smaller than their peers. Having to avoid snacks like chips, instant noodles and ice cream can be another source of stress. “IBD is a devastating disease for children because it stunts growth and drastically lowers their quality of life,” said Shim. “Many young patients suffer from emotional distress. Once they reach adolescence, they often ask, ‘Why am I the only one with this disease?’ — and become depressed.” Shim leads the Care-Kids cohort study, a long-term research project that seeks to offer hope to children with IBD. Launched in 2022, the study involves physicians from 20 hospitals nationwide and tracks patients’ clinical data — including blood samples, stool and endoscopic tissue — over 10 years. With 1,041 patients enrolled and 5,937 vials of biological samples collected, Care-Kids is now the largest pediatric IBD cohort in Asia. The project began with a 300 billion won ($218.6 million) donation from the family of the late Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee, earmarked for pediatric cancer and rare disease research. “Roughly 800 new cases of pediatric IBD are diagnosed annually, and because the disease is rare and patients vary in age, it’s impossible for a single hospital to create nationally representative data,” said Shim. “The donation allowed us to build a large-scale, nationwide study covering about 70 percent of all pediatric cases.” [HEALTH INSURANCE REVIEW & ASSESSMENT SERVICE] In just three years, the study has yielded significant findings. Fifty percent of Korean pediatric Crohn’s patients were found to already have anal fistulas or abscesses at diagnosis — two to three times higher than the 8 to 15 percent rate in Western countries. Based on this, researchers found that using biologic therapies instead of steroids improves treatment outcomes and reduces the need for intestinal surgery. The study also found that 51 percent of Korean children diagnosed with ulcerative colitis already had inflammation throughout the colon, indicating a severe form of the disease from the outset. Additionally, researchers identified unique characteristics in the gut microbiomes of Korean children before and after treatment, raising the possibility of developing new biomarkers. Instead of repeatedly relying on invasive colonoscopies, researchers are working to predict disease activity by analyzing the gut microbiome in stool samples. “Children have difficulty undergoing frequent endoscopies,” said Shim. “Our goal is to develop noninvasive biomarkers that can predict relapses and monitor treatment response based on bacterial composition in the stool.” Beyond research, Care-Kids helps ensure that children across Korea receive standardized care, regardless of hospital size. “There are fewer than 50 pediatric IBD specialists nationwide,” Shim said. “Thanks to the donation, even small hospitals with limited staff can now participate. “I want to be there for the children and help them grow into healthy adults,” she added.

<p><strong>एक महीने लद्दाख में रहेंगे</strong><br />दलाई लामा को भारत सरकार ने इस साल Z+ श्रेणी की सुरक्षा प्रदान की है. लेह एयरपोर्ट पर CRPF के कमांडोज़ की सुरक्षा में उन्हें बाहर लाया गया. इसके अलावा लद्दाख पुलिस ने भी उनकी सुरक्षा के लिए विशेष इंतजाम किए हैं. दलाई लामा लद्दाख में एक महीने तक प्रवास करेंगे और इस दौरान वे जनसभाओं व धार्मिक कार्यक्रमों में भाग ले सकते हैं. इसके चलते उनकी सुरक्षा व्यवस्था को लेकर प्रशासन पूरी तरह सतर्क है.</p>
<p><strong>चीन को फिर चुभेगा दलाई लामा का कदम</strong><br />चीन पहले से ही दलाई लामा के उत्तराधिकारी चयन पर भारत और तिब्बती समुदाय से नाराज है. ऐसे में दलाई लामा का भारत के रणनीतिक रूप से संवेदनशील इलाके लद्दाख में आना चीन को कड़ा संदेश देने जैसा है. दलाई लामा की पिछली लद्दाख यात्रा 2023 में हुई थी. जुलाई 2024 की उनकी लद्दाख यात्रा उनके अमेरिका में घुटने की सर्जरी के कारण रद्द हो गई थी.<br /><br /><strong>चीन के दखल पर रुख सख्त</strong><br />अब उनका यह दौरा उस वक्त हो रहा है जब उनके उत्तराधिकारी को लेकर चर्चा जोरों पर है. इसी बीच उनके कार्यालय की ओर से एक सख्त बयान आया है- 'इस मामले में किसी और को दखल देने का कोई अधिकार नहीं है.' यह टिप्पणी चीन के खिलाफ एक अप्रत्यक्ष हमला मानी जा रही है, जो दावा करता है कि अगला दलाई लामा चुनने का अधिकार उसी के पास है. यह बयान चीन की कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी के उस रुख के खिलाफ साफ चुनौती है, जिसमें वह मानती है कि दलाई लामा का उत्तराधिकारी चुनने का अधिकार केवल उसी के पास है.</p>",2025-07-12,https://www.abplive.com/news/india/dalai-lama-arrives-in-ladakh-on-iaf-s-c-130-aircraft-amidst-china-successor-dispute-china-ann-2978165,ABP Live,China,Politics
804,"केरल में स्कूलों का टाइम बदलने से मुस्लिम संगठन नाराज, बोले- 'क्या सोने के समय चलाएं मदरसे?'","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">समस्त केरल जेम-इय्याथुल उलमा ने शनिवार (12 जुलाई, 2025) को कहा कि स्कूल के संशोधित समय को लागू करने से पहले विचार-विमर्श किए जाने की आवश्यकता है. समस्त केरल जेम-इय्याथुल उलमा, केरल के सुन्नी मुसलमानों के बीच एक प्रमुख धार्मिक संगठन है और इसे आमतौर पर &lsquo;समस्ता&rsquo; भी कहा जाता है.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">प्रमुख इस्लामी विद्वान और समस्ता नेता सैयद जिफरी मुथुकोया थंगल ने कोझिकोड में पत्रकारों से कहा कि इस मुद्दे पर सरकार का प्रतिनिधित्व करने वालों की प्रतिक्रिया विनम्र होनी चाहिए न कि अड़ियल. उन्होंने यह बयान पत्रकारों की तरफ से इस बात की ओर ध्यान दिलाए जाने के जवाब में दिया कि राज्य के सामान्य शिक्षा मंत्री वी. शिवनकुट्टी ने कहा है कि किसी विशेष समुदाय के लिए स्कूल के समय में बदलाव नहीं किया जा सकता.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>मुख्यमंत्री को ज्ञापन का देना होगा जवाब</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">थंगल ने कहा कि समस्ता ने मुख्यमंत्री पिनराई विजयन के समक्ष लिखित रूप में अपनी चिंताएं बताई थीं और उन्हें इसका जवाब देना था. मंत्री (शिवनकुट्टी) जो चाहें कह सकते हैं, लेकिन हमने मुख्यमंत्री को अपना ज्ञापन दिया है. इसलिए उन्हें (विजयन को) जवाब देना होगा.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">उन्होंने कहा कि सरकार समुदायों के हितों की रक्षा करने के लिए मौजूद है. यह एक बड़े समुदाय की जरूरत है. यही समुदाय चुनाव में मत देते हैं तो सरकार को इस मुद्दे पर चर्चा करनी चाहिए. थंगल ने यह भी सवाल उठाया कि क्या मदरसा कक्षाएं सोने के समय आयोजित की जाएंगी, दिन में केवल 24 घंटे होते हैं.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>स्कूलों का समय 30 मिनट बढ़ा</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">इस बीच, शिवनकुट्टी ने दोहराया कि केरल हाई कोर्ट के निर्देशों के अनुसार, स्कूल का समय 30 मिनट बढ़ा दिया गया है. दिन के पहले भाग में 15 मिनट और दूसरे भाग में 15 मिनट. उन्होंने कहा कि वह इस मुद्दे पर कोई &lsquo;अहंकारी&rsquo; रुख नहीं अपना रहे हैं और वह कोर्ट के आदेश से बाहर नहीं जा सकते.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">मंत्री ने कहा कि वह समस्ता या किसी अन्य संगठन के साथ बातचीत करने के लिए तैयार हैं, लेकिन कोर्ट के आदेश के संबंध में कोई चर्चा नहीं हो सकती. स्कूलों के समय में बदलाव राज्य में एक मुद्दा बन गया है और समस्ता समेत कुछ मुस्लिम संगठनों की तरफ से इसका विरोध किया जा रहा है, जिनका तर्क है कि इससे मदरसों की कक्षाएं प्रभावित होंगी.</p>

805,फ्यूल कंट्रोल स्विच पर मान लेते ये बात तो नहीं होता अहमदाबाद प्लेन क्रैश! FAA ने 2018 में दी थी चेतावनी,"<p><strong>Air India Plane Crash: </strong>एयर इंडिया की फ्लाइट AI171 के अहमदाबाद में हुए दर्दनाक हादसे की प्रारंभिक जांच रिपोर्ट सामने आ गई है. इस रिपोर्ट में खुलासा हुआ है कि 2018 में अमेरिका की संघीय उड्डयन प्रशासन (FAA) ने एक विशेष एयरवर्दीनेस सूचना बुलेटिन (SAIB No. NM-18-33) जारी कर बोइंग विमानों में फ्यूल कंट्रोल स्विच की लॉकिंग फीचर के हटने की संभावित समस्या को लेकर चेतावनी दी थी.यह बुलेटिन B787-8 जैसे विमानों को भी शामिल करता था, जिनमें वही पार्ट नंबर लगे होते हैं, जैसा कि दुर्घटनाग्रस्त विमान में था.</p>
<p><strong>क्या है फ्यूल कंट्रोल स्विच की लॉकिंग फीचर की समस्या?</strong><br />फ्यूल कंट्रोल स्विच लॉकिंग फीचर एक सुरक्षा प्रणाली है, जो विमान के इंजन के फ्यूल सप्लाई और कट-ऑफ के बीच अनजाने में होने वाले संचालन को रोकती है. FAA की रिपोर्ट में कहा गया कि अगर यह लॉकिंग फीचर निष्क्रिय हो जाता है, तो स्विच को बिना उठाए ही दोनों पोजिशन (ON और OFF) के बीच बदला जा सकता है, जिससे अनजाने में इंजन बंद होने जैसी गंभीर घटना हो सकती है.</p>
<p><strong>FAA रिपोर्ट की हुई अनदेखी</strong><br />रिपोर्ट में यह भी बताया गया कि FAA की यह चेतावनी अनिवार्य नहीं थी, बल्कि सिर्फ एडवाइजरी थी, इसलिए इससे जुड़े निरीक्षण नहीं किए गए. यह एक अहम बिंदु है, क्योंकि समय रहते यह जांच की गई होती, तो शायद दुर्घटना टाली जा सकती थी. IAF के रिटायर्ड पायलट कैप्टन एहसान खालिद ने बताया कि फ्यूल कट-ऑफ स्विच शारीरिक रूप से पायलट द्वारा चलाया जाता है, यह ऑटोमैटिक नहीं होता. उन्होंने कहा, 'अगर फ्यूल कट-ऑफ स्विच की मूवमेंट रिकॉर्ड हुई है, तो वह पायलट द्वारा इंजन फिर से शुरू करने की कोशिश का संकेत है. लेकिन सच्चाई यह है कि इंजन की पॉवर खुद बंद हो गई थी, पायलट ने कोई इनपुट नहीं दिया था, यह रिपोर्ट से स्पष्ट होता है.'</p>
<p><strong>AAIB की प्रारंभिक रिपोर्ट में क्या है?</strong><br />एयरक्राफ्ट एक्सीडेंट इन्वेस्टिगेशन ब्यूरो (AAIB) ने हादसे के एक महीने बाद 15 पन्नों की प्रारंभिक रिपोर्ट जारी की है, जिसमें प्रारंभिक जांच और अब तक की स्थिति का विवरण है. AI171 विमान, जो अहमदाबाद से लंदन के गैटविक जा रहा था, टेकऑफ के कुछ समय बाद ही एक मेडिकल हॉस्टल कॉम्प्लेक्स से टकरा गया. इस हादसे में 241 यात्रियों में से केवल एक व्यक्ति ही बच सका था.</p>
<p>रिपोर्ट में कहा गया है कि मलबे की जांच, पोस्टमॉर्टम रिपोर्ट और कलपुर्जों की जांच अभी जारी है. अभी तक B787-8 विमान या GE GEnx-1B इंजन ऑपरेटरों के लिए कोई सिफारिश जारी नहीं की गई है.</p>
<p><strong>एयर इंडिया और बोइंग कर रहे हैं सहयोग</strong><br />एयर इंडिया ने कहा है कि वह जांच में पूरी तरह सहयोग कर रही है, और Boeing ने कहा कि वह संयुक्त राष्ट्र के अंतरराष्ट्रीय नागरिक उड्डयन संगठन (ICAO) के Annex 13 प्रोटोकॉल के तहत AAIB को जानकारी साझा करने देगी.</p>",2025-07-12,https://www.abplive.com/news/india/ahemdabad-air-india-plane-crash-ignoring-usa-faa-2018-advisory-on-fuel-control-switch-boeing-in-ai171-lead-to-crash-says-report-2978195,ABP Live,India,General

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">पुलिस ने बताया कि छात्रा ने एक शिक्षक के खिलाफ यौन उत्पीड़न की शिकायत दर्ज कराई थी. उसने बताया कि छात्रा को बचाने का प्रयास करने वाला एक अन्य छात्र भी झुलस गया है और दोनों को जिला मुख्यालय अस्पताल ले जाया गया है. बाद में छात्रा को बेहतर इलाज के लिए भुवनेश्वर स्थित अखिल भारतीय आयुर्विज्ञान संस्थान (एम्स)रेफर कर दिया गया.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>छात्रा ने मामले में कार्रवाई की रखी थी मांग&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">पुलिस के मुताबिक, यह घटना शनिवार दोपहर तब हुई, जब पीड़ित छात्रा ने बालासोर स्थित फकीर मोहन (स्वायत्त) कॉलेज के प्राचार्य दिलीप घोष से मुलाकात की. उसने पहले एक शिक्षक, जो विभागाध्यक्ष भी हैं, के खिलाफ यौन उत्पीड़न की शिकायत दर्ज कराई थी और मामले में कार्रवाई की मांग की थी.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">अधिकारियों ने बताया कि पीड़िता कॉलेज में एकीकृत बीएड पाठ्यक्रम के दूसरे वर्ष की छात्रा है. उसने शिक्षक के खिलाफ कार्रवाई की मांग को लेकर एक हफ्ते तक कॉलेज परिसर में धरना भी दिया था.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>30 जून को दर्ज कराई थी शिकायत</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">प्राचार्य दिलीप घोष ने कहा, &lsquo;छात्रा मेरे पास आई थी और शिक्षक के खिलाफ कार्रवाई चाहती थी. वह तनाव में दिख रही थी, इसलिए मैंने उसकी काउंसलिंग की. उसने 30 जून को शिकायत दर्ज कराई थी. अभी आंतरिक शिकायत समिति (आईसीसी) की जांच चल रही है.&rsquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">एक अधिकारी ने बताया कि पुलिस ने आरोपी शिक्षक को बालासोर शहर के सहदेवखुंटा पुलिस थाने में हिरासत में ले लिया है. उन्होंने बताया कि पुलिस अधीक्षक राज प्रसाद और एक वैज्ञानिक टीम मौके पर मामले की जांच कर रही है.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>पीड़िता के दोस्तों ने दी ये जानकारी</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">इस बीच, अस्पताल का दौरा करने वाले बालासोर के विधायक मानस दत्ता ने कहा, &lsquo;छात्रा की हालत गंभीर है. हमारी पहली प्राथमिकता उसकी जान बचाना है.&rsquo; पीड़िता के मित्रों के मुताबिक, विभागाध्यक्ष की ओर से कथित उत्पीड़न के कारण छात्रा पिछले कई दिनों से गंभीर मानसिक तनाव में थी. उसके दोस्तों ने बताया कि पीड़िता की पीड़ा तब और बढ़ गई, जब न तो कॉलेज प्रशासन और न ही पुलिस ने आरोपी शिक्षक के खिलाफ कोई कार्रवाई की.</p>

Ltd. और इसकी ग्रुप कंपनियों की 681.54 करोड़ रुपये की प्रॉपर्टी अटैच कर दी है. ये कार्रवाई मनी लॉन्ड्रिंग के मामले में की गई है. आरोप है कि कंपनी ने हजारों घर खरीदारों से पैसे लेकर उन्हें फ्लैट और प्लॉट देने में भारी धोखा किया.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ED की तरफ से अटैच की गई प्रॉपर्टी में गुरुग्राम के सेक्टर 37D, 92 और 95 में बनी करीब 226 एकड़ की दो कॉलोनियां शामिल हैं. इसके अलावा करीब 1700 एकड़ की जमीन भी अटैच की गई है, जो गुरुग्राम के गांव बसई, गढ़ोली कलां, हयातपुर और वाजीरपुर में है.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>इन प्रोजेक्ट के जरिए लोगों से ठगे पैसे</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ED ने अपनी जांच में पाया कि Ramprastha Developers ने साल 2008 से 2011 के बीच कई प्रोजेक्ट्स लॉन्च किए, जिनमें Project Edge, Project Skyz, Project Rise और Ramprastha City शामिल है. इन प्रोजेक्ट्स के लिए कंपनी ने 2000 से ज्यादा लोगों से करीब 1100 करोड़ रुपये जमा किए थे, लेकिन आज तक ना तो फ्लैट दिए गए और ना ही प्लॉट की पजेशन दी गई.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>फ्लैट निर्माण की जगह यहां लगाए पैसे</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">जांच में ये भी सामने आया कि कंपनी के प्रमोटर्स अरविंद वालिया, बलवंत चौधरी सिंह और संदीप यादव ने होम बायर्स से मिले पैसे को दूसरी ग्रुप कंपनियों में ट्रांसफर कर दिया. ये पैसा जमीन खरीदने या दूसरे कामों में लगाया गया, जबकि इसका इस्तेमाल फ्लैट बनाने के लिए किया जाना था.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">इस मामले में दिल्ली और हरियाणा पुलिस की Economic Offences Wing ने कई FIR दर्ज की थी. इन्हीं शिकायतों के आधार पर ED ने मनी लॉन्ड्रिंग का केस दर्ज कर जांच शुरू की. ED की जांच अभी भी जारी है और आगे और खुलासे हो सकते हैं.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">डी.के. शिवकुमार का यह बयान ऐसे समय पर आया है जब कर्नाटक में पावर शेयरिंग और सत्ता के नेतृत्व के संभावित परिवर्तन को लेकर चर्चाएं जोरों पर हैं. हालांकि, राज्य के मुख्यमंत्री सिद्धारमैया पहले ही इन अटकलों को सिरे से खारिज कर चुके हैं और उन्होंने इस बात पर जोर देते हुए कहा है कि वह अपने पूरा पांच साल के कार्यकाल को जरूर पूरा करेंगे.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>उपमुख्यमंत्री डीके शिवकुमार ने दिया बयान</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">हरियाणा के गुरुग्राम में स्थित अपने परिवार के घर में गुरुवार (10 जुलाई) को दीपक यादव ने अपनी बेटी राधिका को गोली मारकर हत्या कर दी थी. इस घटना को अंजाम देने के बाद गुरुग्राम पुलिस ने उसे गिरफ्तार कर लिया और कोर्ट ने हत्या के आरोपी पिता को 14 दिनों की न्यायिक हिरासत में भेज दिया है.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>पुलिस की पूछताछ के दौरान आरोपी पिता ने दिया बयान</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">पुलिस की पूछताछ के दौरान दीपक ने इस बात को कबूल किया है कि वह गांव वालों के तानों से मानसिक रूप से काफी परेशान था और पिछले 15 दिनों से वह ठीक से सो भी नहीं पाया था. वह काफी ज्यादा बेचैन रहने लगा था और अपने घर में इधर-उधर घूमता रहता था. इसके अलावा, उसने अपने परिवार के लोगों से भी बातचीत करना छोड़ दिया था.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>राधिका की टेनिस ट्रेनिंग पर दीपक ने खर्च किए थे 2.5 करोड़ रुपये</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">बेटी की हत्या के आरोपी पिता दीपक यादव ने राधिका के बचपन से ही उसकी टेनिस की ट्रेनिंग पर 2.5 करोड़ रुपये से ज्यादा खर्च किए थे. हालांकि, दो साल पहले राधिका को एक चोट लगी थी, जिसके कारण राधिका कॉम्पटेटिव टेनिस में अपने करियर को और आगे नहीं बढ़ा सकी.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">कॉम्पटेटिव टेनिस के करियर पर ब्रेक लगने के बाद राधिका ने टेनिस की कोचिंग देने की शुरुआत की. वह अलग-अलग जगहों पर टेनिस कोर्ट बुक कर खेल प्रेमियों को प्रशिक्षण देने लगी थीं. इसके साथ ही वह सोशल मीडिया इन्फ्लुएंसर बनने की भी कोशिश कर रही थीं. यहां तक की राधिका एक साल पहले रिलीज हुए एक म्यूजिक वीडियो में भी नजर आई थीं. इसके अलावा, वह सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म इंस्टाग्राम पर नियमित रूप से रील्स बनाकर अपलोड करती थीं.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>दीपक ने बेटी के बंद कराए सोशल मीडिया अकाउंट्स, कोचिंग के लिए भी बनाया दबाव</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">हालांकि, दीपक अपनी बेटी की सोशल मीडिया पर मौजूदगी से काफी नाराज था. इस कारण से दीपक ने राधिका पर बार-बार सोशल मीडिया अकाउंट्स डिलीट करने का भी दबाव डाला, जिसके कुछ समय के बाद राधिका ने अपने सोशल मीडिया अकाउंट्स डिलीट कर दिए थे.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">सोशल मीडिया अकाउंट्स बंद कराने के बाद दीपक राधिका पर टेनिस कोचिंग देना भी बंद करने का दबाव बना रहा था. उन्होंने खुद अपनी बेटी राधिका की ट्रेनिंग के लिए करोड़ों रुपये खर्च किए थे, लेकिन गांव और समाज के लोगों की आलोचनाओं और तानों को लेकर काफी संवेदनशील हो गए थे.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>पिता से विश्वास बनाए रखने के लिए अनुरोध करती थी राधिका</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">दीपक ब्रोकरी के धंधे से सालाना 15 लाख रुपये कमा लेता था. इसलिए वह अपनी बेटी से अक्सर कहता था कि वह अपनी अकादमी बंद कर दे, वह परिवार का खर्च उठाने में खुद सक्षम है. लेकिन राधिका अपने सपनों को लेकर प्रतिबद्ध थी और वह लगातार अपने पिता को विश्वास बनाए रखने का अनुरोध करती थी. वह अपने पिता से कहती थी, &ldquo;आपने मुझ पर 2.5 करोड़ रुपये खर्च किए हैं. मैं उस पैसे को बर्बाद नहीं होने दूंगी. मैं अपनी टेनिस प्रतिभा और अनुभव से दूसरे युवाओं को टेनिस की ट्रेनिंग दूंगी.""</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FIR के अनुसार, यह फर्जी कॉल सेंटर जुलाई 2024 से पुणे के प्राइड आइकॉन बिल्डिंग की 9वीं मंजिल से संचालित हो रहा था. आरोप है कि यह गिरोह अमेरिका के नागरिकों को नकली लोन स्कीम के जाल में फंसाकर उनके बैंक खाते और निजी विवरण हासिल करता था. जांच में सामने आया है कि आरोपी खुद को अमेरिकी बैंकों का प्रतिनिधि बताकर लोन ऑफर देता था और इस धोखे से पीड़ितों की संवेदनशील जानकारी हासिल कर लाखों डॉलर ठगते थे.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>ठगी की राशि को ऐसे किया जाता था स्टोर</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ED की प्रारंभिक जांच के अनुसार, ठगी की राशि को अमेरिका में मौजूद साथियों के माध्यम से क्रिप्टोकरेंसी (मुख्यतः USDT) में बदला गया और Trust Wallet, Exodus Wallet जैसे डिजिटल वॉलेट्स में स्टोर किया गया. बाद में इस धनराशि को पारंपरिक अंगड़िया चैनल के जरिए भारत लाकर अहमदाबाद में नकद में बदल दिया गया.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">आगे की जांच में खुलासा हुआ कि इस फर्जीवाड़े से कमाई गई रकम का एक हिस्सा मूल कंपनी के खातों में ट्रांसफर किया गया, जिसका उपयोग सॉफ्टवेयर खरीद और ऑफिस का किराया देने में किया गया. वहीं, बड़ा हिस्सा सोना, चांदी, वाहन, रियल एस्टेट और निजी संपत्तियों की खरीद में खर्च किया गया.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>छापेमारी में मिले ये सामान</strong></p>
